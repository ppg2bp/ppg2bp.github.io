The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Cuffless and continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using wearable devices is of great clinical value and health monitoring importance. Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

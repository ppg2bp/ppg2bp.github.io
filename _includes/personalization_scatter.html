Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg. For the DBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20131.30 \u00b1 7.18 mmHg. The results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is within the 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg ISO/ANSI/AAMI protocol requirement.","\u2026 increased or decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SP and DP) \u2026 below) were available to estimate the BP change prediction model\u2026 We specifically estimated 32 models using data from all \u2026","NaN","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking.

Predictive models to estimate BP using a variety of sensor-\u2026 Although this study demonstrates an evaluation of cuffless BP in the setting \u2026","Although various predictors and methods for BP estimation have been proposed, differences in study designs have led to difficulties in determining the optimal method. This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg. For the DBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20131.30 \u00b1 7.18 mmHg. The results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is within the 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg ISO/ANSI/AAMI protocol requirement.","\u2026 In this study, we aimed to estimate blood pressure (BP) from in-\u2026 Calibrated systolic BP estimation accuracy was significantly \u2026 for wearable cuff-less blood pressure monitoring system Sci. \u2026","\u2026 was 6.70 mmHg for systolic and 4.42 for diastolic BP.

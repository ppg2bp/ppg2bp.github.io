Wearable and unobtrusive sensing devices are rapidly evolving for long-term cardiovascular monitoring. However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors.

However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively. Conclusion: In clinical practice over 24\u2009hours, there was a significant difference between the TestBP and RefBP with higher systolic and diastolic BP measured with the cuffless PTT device.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03493867","The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2]. Pulse transit time (PTT), \u2026 such as the systolic upstroke time, diastolic time, width of 2/3, 1/\u2026","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension. The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

The proposed multi-sensor platform was comprised of one ECG sensor and two pulse pressure wave sensors for simultaneous signal collection. After extracting 35 features from the collected signals, a weakly supervised feature selection method was proposed for dimension reduction because the reference oscillometric technique-based BP are intermittent and can be redeemed as coarse-grained labels. BP models were then established using a multi-instance regression algorithm. A total of 85 participants including 17 hypertensive and 12 hypotensive patients were enrolled. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach exhibited good accuracy for diverse population with an estimation error of 1.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.76 mmHg for SBP, 1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.03 mmHg for MAP, and 1.49 \u00b1 5.52 for DBP, which complied with the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation standards in BP estimation. Moreover, the estimation accuracy is with random daily fluctuations rather than long-term degradation through a maximum two-month follow-up period indicated good robustness performance.

Moreover, the estimation accuracy is with random daily fluctuations rather than long-term degradation through a maximum two-month follow-up period indicated good robustness performance. These results suggest that the proposed approach is with high reliability and robustness and thus provides a novel insight for cuff-less BP measurement.","NaN","The objective is to develop a cuffless modelling approach to accurately estimate the blood pressure (BP) waveform and extract important BP features, such as the systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean BP (MAP). Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

By mounting the \u2026 the PTT estimated and the reference overnight systolic BP (\u2026 IV or V is used to detect diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The \u2026","Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended to improve the management of hypertension. Here, we investigated the accuracy of BP estimated using a wearable cuff-less device, InBodyWATCH, compared with BP measured using a manual sphygmomanometer. Thirty-five adults were enrolled (age 57.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 years). The BP was estimated using InBodyWATCH with an individualized estimation based on a neural network model. Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland\u2013Altman plots (n\u2009=\u2009105 paired BP readings). The correlations for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) between the two devices were high (r\u2009=\u20090.964 and 0.939, both P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The mean difference was 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 mmHg for SBP and \u22120.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 mmHg for DBP; these were not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.472 for SBP and P\u2009=\u20090.880 for DBP). The proportions of estimated SBP/DBP obtained from the InBodyWATCH within\u2009\u00b1\u20095 mmHg of manual SBP/DBP were 71.4%/83.8%; within\u2009\u00b1\u200910 mmHg they were 86.7%/98.1%; and within\u2009\u00b1\u200915 mmHg they were 97.1%/99.0%. The estimated BP from this wearable cuff-less device correlated highly with the manual BP and showed good accuracy, suggesting its potential to be used in ambulatory BP monitoring.","NaN","Pulse transit time (PTT) based continuous cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring has attracted wide interests owing to its potential in improving the control and early prevention for cardiovascular diseases. However, it is still impractical in large-scale clinical application due to the concern of BP measurement accuracy. Since such approach strongly relies on the PTT-BP model under certain theoretical assumptions, the accuracy would be affected by the vessel properties alterations induced by cardiovascular disorders. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases which often coexist with hypertension. The present study sought to examine the Impact of AF on the PTT and BP\uff0c validate the capability of PTT based cuff-less methods on AF patients. By investigating the PTT and BP on 74 critically ill patients with AF, we found that parameters including PTT, R-R interval and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly changed when AF occurs, while the systolic BP (SBP) value and photoplethysmography intensity ratio (PIR) changed little. Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship. But the PIR would still be a predictive factor for BP estimation for AF patients.","\u2026 estimate the two extreme values of BP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 By using a low-power consumption wearable prototype made by SmartCardia, we \u2026","\u2026 of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques.

of daily continuous blood pressure (DCBP) has a strong impact to realization of healthy society. However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position.

This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Deploying this technology at a community level may be also useful to drive public health interventions against the epidemy of hypertension.","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions.

After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position. Differences for diastolic BP readings were respectively of 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.86 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20091.93\u2009\u00b1\u20097.65 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20094.22\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56 mmHg and\u2009\u2212\u20094.85\u2009\u00b1\u20099.11 mmHg. This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Deploying this technology at a community level may be also useful to drive public health interventions against the epidemy of hypertension.","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements.

Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures. Our work allows the user to passively monitor BP during common weighing scale measurement, potentially improving the ease of longitudinal at-home care."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2960063"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Andrew M.

However, conventional blood pressure measurement is unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to its discomfort and poor portability. Wearable device is an ideal solution to overcome this problem, which has attracted increasing interests of many researchers. While, high-performance wearable blood pressure sensor still remains a challenge. Here, we present a wearable blood pressure wristband system based on optical fiber. The end face of optical fiber was coated with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) + Ag composite diaphragm. The continuous and accurate measurement of the pulse waveform was achieved through the phase variation of the light reflected from the diaphragm. Then, the blood pressure can be estimated from the pulse transit time (PTT) which is extracted from the high-fidelity pulse waveform. The estimation model was established using data from 45 subjects. The clinical experiment was also carried out on 17 subjects to test the performance of the proposed wearable blood pressure wristband. The results show that the errors of systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are 0.24 \u00b1 2.39 mmHg and 0.12 \u00b1 2.62 mmHg compared with commercial sphygmomanometer, respectively. The measurement errors were within the required range of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) Grade A, which indicates that the blood pressure wristband has a good accuracy and practicability.

Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

pocket-size cuffless electronic device for self-measurement of blood pressure (BP) has been developed (Freescan, Maisense Inc., Zhubei, Taiwan). The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2). These data suggest that this prototype cuffless BP monitor provides valid self-measurements in the vast majority of adults, and satisfies the BP measurement accuracy criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 2013 validation protocol."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2016.101"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["N.

However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors. ConclusionThe wrist monitor showed fair agreement with the arm monitor in the ambulatory condition, and was stable irrespective of arm positions.","NaN","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAyQAAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["none","proprietary","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MBP.0b013e32835d124f","https://www.medtach.com/uploads/1/9/7/9/19798371/bpro_-_progress_on_the_development_of_the_mediwatch_ambulatory.pdf","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2012.0006"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["T.

such cuffs tend to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures. Our work allows the user to passively monitor BP during common weighing scale measurement, potentially improving the ease of longitudinal at-home care."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2960063"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Andrew M.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The new liquid\u2010capsule\u2010based sensor platform may help to realize an accurate, flexible, robust, and low\u2010power solution for next\u2010generation wearable health monitoring devices."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[7]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","deep learning","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ISPS/proceedings-abstract/ISPS2017/V001T02A003/267020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805045"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[7]},"Authors":["Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","PCP Chao, TY Tu","Xiangyu Fan, Y.

non-invasive and cuff-less method to measure blood pressure (BP). \u2026 long-term monitoring, which requires a portable device. \u2026 Togawa, \u201cContinuous estimation of systolic blood pressure \u2026","Objective: Recently, a cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement device using pulse transit time (PTT) for beat-to-beat calculation of BP values has been validated over a short time period. However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03493867","The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2].

The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively.

The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship.

of daily continuous blood pressure (DCBP) has a strong impact to realization of healthy society. However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control. The aim of this study was to compare a smartphone application (app)-based algorithm with office BPM (OBPM). (2) Methods: We included consecutive patients with an indication for ambulatory BPM. The smartphone app (RIVA digital) acquired the pulse wave in the fingers\u2019 arterial bed using the phone\u2019s camera and estimated BP based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms. Measurements were alternatingly taken with an oscillometric cuff-based device and smartphone BPM (AppBP) on two consecutive days. AppBP were calibrated to the first OBPM. Each AppBP was compared to its CuffBP (mean of the previous/following OBPM). (3) Results: 50 participants were included, resulting in 50 AppBP values on Day 1 and 33 on Day 2 after exclusion of 225 AppBP due to insufficient quality. The mean \u00b1 SD of the differences between AppBP and CuffBP was 0.7 \u00b1 9.4/1.0 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg (p-value 0.739/0.201) on Day 1 and 2.6 \u00b1 8.2/1.3 \u00b1 4.1 mmHg (p-value 0.106/0.091) on Day 2 for systolic/diastolic values, respectively. There were no significant differences between the deviations on Day 1 and Day 2 (p-value 0.297/0.533 for systolic/diastolic values). Overall, there were 10 (12%) systolic measurement pairs differing by &gt;15 mmHg.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position.

This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

Maisense Inc., Zhubei, Taiwan). The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2). These data suggest that this prototype cuffless BP monitor provides valid self-measurements in the vast majority of adults, and satisfies the BP measurement accuracy criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 2013 validation protocol."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2016.101"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["N.

However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

however, such cuffs tend to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures. Our work allows the user to passively monitor BP during common weighing scale measurement, potentially improving the ease of longitudinal at-home care."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2960063"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Andrew M.

However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively. The BPs estimation errors satisfy the requirements of the IEEE standard 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, our method may be used for ubiquitous continuous BP monitoring."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tim.2021.3122182"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["M.

However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively. The BPs estimation errors satisfy the requirements of the IEEE standard 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, our method may be used for ubiquitous continuous BP monitoring."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tim.2021.3122182"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["M.

However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively.

MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors. ConclusionThe wrist monitor showed fair agreement with the arm monitor in the ambulatory condition, and was stable irrespective of arm positions.","NaN","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAyQAAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["none","proprietary","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MBP.0b013e32835d124f","https://www.medtach.com/uploads/1/9/7/9/19798371/bpro_-_progress_on_the_development_of_the_mediwatch_ambulatory.pdf","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/dia.2012.0006"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["T.

The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2).

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

diagnosis in daily life. However, conventional blood pressure measurement is unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to its discomfort and poor portability. Wearable device is an ideal solution to overcome this problem, which has attracted increasing interests of many researchers. While, high-performance wearable blood pressure sensor still remains a challenge. Here, we present a wearable blood pressure wristband system based on optical fiber. The end face of optical fiber was coated with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) + Ag composite diaphragm. The continuous and accurate measurement of the pulse waveform was achieved through the phase variation of the light reflected from the diaphragm. Then, the blood pressure can be estimated from the pulse transit time (PTT) which is extracted from the high-fidelity pulse waveform. The estimation model was established using data from 45 subjects. The clinical experiment was also carried out on 17 subjects to test the performance of the proposed wearable blood pressure wristband. The results show that the errors of systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are 0.24 \u00b1 2.39 mmHg and 0.12 \u00b1 2.62 mmHg compared with commercial sphygmomanometer, respectively. The measurement errors were within the required range of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) Grade A, which indicates that the blood pressure wristband has a good accuracy and practicability.

However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study. These results indicated that PPW obtained from the piezoelectric sensor has great feasibility for cuffless blood pressure estimation, and could serve as a promising method in home healthcare settings.","Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The new liquid\u2010capsule\u2010based sensor platform may help to realize an accurate, flexible, robust, and low\u2010power solution for next\u2010generation wearable health monitoring devices."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[7]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","deep learning","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ISPS/proceedings-abstract/ISPS2017/V001T02A003/267020","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805045"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[7]},"Authors":["Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","PCP Chao, TY Tu","Xiangyu Fan, Y.

transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement. However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study. These results indicated that PPW obtained from the piezoelectric sensor has great feasibility for cuffless blood pressure estimation, and could serve as a promising method in home healthcare settings.","Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure.

However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control. The aim of this study was to compare a smartphone application (app)-based algorithm with office BPM (OBPM). (2) Methods: We included consecutive patients with an indication for ambulatory BPM. The smartphone app (RIVA digital) acquired the pulse wave in the fingers\u2019 arterial bed using the phone\u2019s camera and estimated BP based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms. Measurements were alternatingly taken with an oscillometric cuff-based device and smartphone BPM (AppBP) on two consecutive days. AppBP were calibrated to the first OBPM. Each AppBP was compared to its CuffBP (mean of the previous/following OBPM). (3) Results: 50 participants were included, resulting in 50 AppBP values on Day 1 and 33 on Day 2 after exclusion of 225 AppBP due to insufficient quality. The mean \u00b1 SD of the differences between AppBP and CuffBP was 0.7 \u00b1 9.4/1.0 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg (p-value 0.739/0.201) on Day 1 and 2.6 \u00b1 8.2/1.3 \u00b1 4.1 mmHg (p-value 0.106/0.091) on Day 2 for systolic/diastolic values, respectively. There were no significant differences between the deviations on Day 1 and Day 2 (p-value 0.297/0.533 for systolic/diastolic values). Overall, there were 10 (12%) systolic measurement pairs differing by &gt;15 mmHg. (4) Conclusions: In this pilot evaluation, the RIVA Digital app shows promising results when compared to oscillometric cuff-based measurements, especially regarding diastolic values. Its differences between AppBP\u2013CuffBP have a good stability one day after calibration. Before clinical use, signal acquisition needs improvement and the algorithm needs to undergo formal validation against a gold-standard BPM method.","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position. Differences for diastolic BP readings were respectively of 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.86 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20091.93\u2009\u00b1\u20097.65 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20094.22\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56 mmHg and\u2009\u2212\u20094.85\u2009\u00b1\u20099.11 mmHg. This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Deploying this technology at a community level may be also useful to drive public health interventions against the epidemy of hypertension.","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions.

for beat-to-beat calculation of BP values has been validated over a short time period. However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively. Conclusion: In clinical practice over 24\u2009hours, there was a significant difference between the TestBP and RefBP with higher systolic and diastolic BP measured with the cuffless PTT device.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03493867","The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2]. Pulse transit time (PTT), \u2026 such as the systolic upstroke time, diastolic time, width of 2/3, 1/\u2026","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension. The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device. By mounting the \u2026 the PTT estimated and the reference overnight systolic BP (\u2026 IV or V is used to detect diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The \u2026","Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended to improve the management of hypertension. Here, we investigated the accuracy of BP estimated using a wearable cuff-less device, InBodyWATCH, compared with BP measured using a manual sphygmomanometer. Thirty-five adults were enrolled (age 57.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 years). The BP was estimated using InBodyWATCH with an individualized estimation based on a neural network model. Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland\u2013Altman plots (n\u2009=\u2009105 paired BP readings). The correlations for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) between the two devices were high (r\u2009=\u20090.964 and 0.939, both P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The mean difference was 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 mmHg for SBP and \u22120.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 mmHg for DBP; these were not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.472 for SBP and P\u2009=\u20090.880 for DBP). The proportions of estimated SBP/DBP obtained from the InBodyWATCH within\u2009\u00b1\u20095 mmHg of manual SBP/DBP were 71.4%/83.8%; within\u2009\u00b1\u200910 mmHg they were 86.7%/98.1%; and within\u2009\u00b1\u200915 mmHg they were 97.1%/99.0%. The estimated BP from this wearable cuff-less device correlated highly with the manual BP and showed good accuracy, suggesting its potential to be used in ambulatory BP monitoring.","NaN","Pulse transit time (PTT) based continuous cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring has attracted wide interests owing to its potential in improving the control and early prevention for cardiovascular diseases. However, it is still impractical in large-scale clinical application due to the concern of BP measurement accuracy. Since such approach strongly relies on the PTT-BP model under certain theoretical assumptions, the accuracy would be affected by the vessel properties alterations induced by cardiovascular disorders. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases which often coexist with hypertension. The present study sought to examine the Impact of AF on the PTT and BP\uff0c validate the capability of PTT based cuff-less methods on AF patients. By investigating the PTT and BP on 74 critically ill patients with AF, we found that parameters including PTT, R-R interval and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly changed when AF occurs, while the systolic BP (SBP) value and photoplethysmography intensity ratio (PIR) changed little. Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship. But the PIR would still be a predictive factor for BP estimation for AF patients.","\u2026 estimate the two extreme values of BP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 By using a low-power consumption wearable prototype made by SmartCardia, we \u2026","\u2026 of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques.

will greatly impact the medical field. This work presents a millimeter-wave, radar-based system for performing accurate measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at the radial artery. A 120-subject study was conducted to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach. Blood pressure was determined using a one-time initialization process that converts radar output into pressure units (in mmHg). Measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure values against a clinical reference device show promise for beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement in a variety of healthcare settings."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BSN51625.2021.9507020"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Catherine Liao, Oliver Shay, Elizabeth Gomes, Nikhil Bikhchandani"],"BP Distribution":["NaN"],"BP Distribution Type":["unclear;

<p>While other review papers have used common metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and percent error, these cannot be applied due to the large heterogeneity in datasets, devices, and algorithms used in each study. For example, a study with a dataset with small BP distribution may yield better results, as there is less variation that the model needs to explain. Here, we provide a brief summary of the statistics to account for heterogeneity in dataset distributions and calibration technique between studies and provide analysis with interactive visuals. For specific details related to methodology, see <a href="/methods/">Methods</a> and our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10">paper</a>.

<h2> Summary Statistics </h2>

<p>In addition to the performance criteria stated in the standards, we condition our performance metric based on the BP distribution, which is a significant source of heterogeneity between studies. To accomplish this, we adopt an interpretable statistic coined Explained Deviation (ED). For subject split, ED is used to compute the effectiveness of a device with estimation error parameterized by ($\mu_\epsilon, \sigma_\epsilon$) on a population parameterized by (\(\mu_{pop}\), \(\sigma_{pop}\)), where $\mu$ represents the mean and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation. The ED can be computed as \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sigma_\epsilon}\). The higher the ED, the better the system performs. On the other hand, an ED of 1 indicates that the estimator performs no better than an estimator that predicts a constant value. Intuitively, this statistic determines how much the model “explains” the BP distribution. Statistically, ED is similar to an F-test for the ratio of two variances with equal sample size, the null hypothesis \(H_0: ED \leq ED_{min}\), and the alternative hypothesis \(H_1: ED &gt; ED_{min}\) where \(ED_{min}\) is the computed minimum Explained Deviation that meets the standards (See Supplementary 1). One limitation of using ED is the assumptions of zero bias and normality, which are not always the case. However, this gives a good ballpark estimate in practice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we can compute confidence intervals using the F-distribution by determining the bounds \(P(\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} \leq ED_{true} \leq \sqrt{F_{1-\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est})  = 1-\alpha\) where \(\alpha\) is the level of significance, \(P\) are the probability, \(F\) is the F-distribution and \(n\) in the sample size (Supplementary 1). The Margin of Error is half the Confidence Interval. Using the same formulation, we compute ED for personalization. However, in this case, we must take the change in BP of each subject into account: \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}}{\sigma_{\Delta BP}}\), where \(\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}\) is the BP change error of the study cohort and \(\sigma_{\Delta BP}\) is the standard deviation of the BP changes of the study cohort. Finally, to determine whether the sample size is sufficient to detect the reported result, we compute power (\(p\)). To do this we define \(\alpha=0.05\), \(\beta=0.02\), and effect size \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), based on <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/aami/ansiaamiiso810602019">ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2019</a>. This corresponds to \(p=0.98\) and a sample size of approximately 85 (Supplementary 2).</p>

<h2> Estimating required Explained Deviation from AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-2:2019 </h2>

<p>The AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standard specifies that a device that for the general population should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have n=85 subjects, should include ≥30% males and ≥30% females</li>
  <li>Have ≥5% of the reference SBP readings ≤100 mm Hg, ≥5% with ≥160 mmHg, and ≥20% with ≥140 mmHg</li>
  <li>Have ≥5% of reference DBP readings ≤60 mmHg, ≥5% with ≥100 mmHg, and ≥20% with ≥85 mm Hg</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there are no publicly available datasets that satisfy these demographics. However, the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PPG-BP_Database_zip/5459299">PPG-BP</a> can meet these requirements if it is subsampled. To determine a subsample that satisfied the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards, we performed weighted sampling of subjects, where the weights were determined using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) marginalized on the requirements. We repeat this process 10000 times and determine the minimum variance of the subsampled datasets. Then, we took the maximum error standard deviation allowed by AAMI/ANSI/ISO (±8mmHg). The minimum ED for SBP and DBP was computed to be 2.17 and 1.39. The implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wearablebp">Github</a>.</p>

<h2> Synthesis of studies </h2>

<p>Using our proposed metric to evaluate estimation accuracy, we plot the ED of SBP versus ED of DBP for subject split and personalization studies. We indicate the size of points using the power of the study and also report important study information using a hover tool. Moreover, we delineate in green the minimum ED (\(ED_{min}\)), computed from the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards for SBP and DBP, which were 2.17 and 1.39 respectively.</p>

pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP. RMS error, measured by leave-one-out method, reduced from 8.45 mm Hg to 5.77 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.67 mm Hg to 6.90 mm Hg for MAP."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Rasool et al."],"BP Distribution":["107\u00b18.62"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ff7f00"],"DBP Distribution Raw":["NaN"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQrXHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b17.71"],"DOI":["10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAABgbEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Rasool et al.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.

This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC.

The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

has become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["deep learning"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Cao et al."],"BP Distribution":["110\u00b126.1; 69.3\u00b115.1"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#6a3d9a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 69.3\u00b115.1"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"MzMzMzMzLkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"BMJiknqGAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"F8HI7j179z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"Ir/hXX5CB0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"Lb36zL4J5z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"PQrXo3A9HUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.67\u00b17.31"],"DOI":["10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"Dataset":["Internal+MIMIC"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAgdkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Cao et al.

such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC.

The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

pressure (BP) measurement data is an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP. RMS error, measured by leave-one-out method, reduced from 8.45 mm Hg to 5.77 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.67 mm Hg to 6.90 mm Hg for MAP."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Rasool et al."],"BP Distribution":["107\u00b18.62"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ff7f00"],"DBP Distribution Raw":["NaN"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQrXHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b17.71"],"DOI":["10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAABgbEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Rasool et al.

This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

has become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

patients in critical state. To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

<h2> Supplementary 1: Explained Deviation Confidence Interval </h2>

<p>Assume:</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(n_1\) in dependent observations from a normally distributed popoulation with variance \(\sigma_1^2\) and</li>
  <li>\(n_2\) independent observations from a normall distributed population with variance \(\sigma_2^2\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Given sample variance \(s_1^2\) and \(s_2^2\), we can write \(\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2}{\sigma_1} \sim \chi_{n_1-1}^2\) and \(\frac{(n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{\sigma_2} \sim \chi_{n_2-1}^2\) <br /> The ratio of these two distributions is a F-distribution and can be written in the form \(F=\frac{s_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{s_2^2/\sigma_2^2}\) <br /> The \(1-\alpha\) confidence interval can be written as \(P(F_{\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1) \lt \frac{s_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{s_2^2/\sigma_2^2} \lt F_{1-\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1)\) <br /> Simplying the expression, using the identity \(F_{1-\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1) = \frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2}(n_2-1, n_1-1)}\), and substituting \(\frac{s_1}{s_2}=ED_{est}\) and \(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}=ED_{true}\) gives \(P(\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} &lt; ED_{true} &lt; \sqrt{F_{1-\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est})  = 1-\alpha\)</p>

<h2> Supplementary 2: Power Analysis </h2>

<p>Compute \(p=1-\beta=\phi(ES \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}-z_{1-\alpha/2}))\) where \(ES\) (effect size) is given by error bias/error standard deviation=\(\frac{5}{8}\), \(\alpha\) is the selected level of significance, \(\beta=1-P\), and \(\phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution</p>

<h2> Method </h2>

<h4> Protocol and Registration, Information Sources, and Search </h4>
<p>Keywords “wearable”, “blood pressure”, “monitoring”, “estimation”, “systolic”, “diastolic”, and “cuffless” were entered into the search tool <a href="https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish">Publish or Perish</a> on 5/10/2022 which retrieves and analyzes academic citations from external data sources, including Crossref, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The Maximum number of results were specified as 1000 and the articles were specified in the time-frame of 1979-2022. Additional studies were included from Google Scholar alerts of “blood pressure device” and from article references.</p>

<h4> Eligibility Criteria </h4>
<p>We develop an Eligibility Criteria to determine whether studies should be included or excluded from analysis. First, we include studies that report mean absolute error (MAE) or bias±standard deviation of error (ME) for Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure estimation. The AAMI/ANSI/ISO, BHS, and IEEE Standards all require either ME or MAE. Moreover, we can compute ME to MAE and vice versa (assuming zero bias) through a folded normal distribution. Second, we require the article to be written in the English language. Third, we only include studies that do not suffer from data leakage. In order to properly compare and contrast data, we must stratify by algorithmic level calibration technique. We coin the terms “record level split without personalization”, “subject level split”, and “personalization” to distinguish between calibration techniques. Record level split without personalization involves having data in the training and testing set from the same subjects, therefore suffering from data leakage. For example, randomly sampled segments from a subject are included in both the training and test set. Unfortunately there are currently no useful applications for the record level split without personalization calibration technique. On the other hand, Subject level split, which can be thought of as “population level calibration”, involves using different subjects in the training and testing sets. For example, if 100 subjects are in the dataset, 50 subjects are used for training the model and the other 50 are used for testing the model. In contrast, personalization, which can be thought of as “individual level calibration”, is a subset of record level split. This involves performing record level split with a temporal constraint, in which the training data is selected as the first portion of records and the testing data is selected as the latter portion of the record without overlap with the training data. For example, if a record for a single subject is 1 month long, data from the first day is used for training and the rest is used for testing. This individual level model is usually recalibrated at arbitrary intervals due to physiological changes that may render the model inaccurate. We only include articles that claim to perform subject level split or personalization. Fourth, we exclude models that dynamically update based on individual subjects and their time stamps. Fifth, we only include studies that perform experiments on human subjects, as we aim to deploy these devices on humans. Finally, we only include studies that have number of test subjects greater than 1 due to inability to compute blood pressure distributions of subject population. For studies that are not included, we provide a exclusion reason.</p>

<h4> Data Collection Process and Data Items </h4>

<p>A single author performed extraction of predefined data parameters. For studies that had multiple protocols and reported multiple results, the multiple entries were made in the compiled database. The predefined data fields include: Key Devices and Measurements, Calibration Technique, Algorithm,	Dataset, Number of Test Subjects, Training Subject Characteristics, Testing Subject Characteristics, Study Characteristics (observational or interventional study), BP Distribution, Evaluation Metric, and Reported Result. For personalization articles, we report the Time between Calibration and Test. To estimate the SBP and DBP population standard deviation when the BP distribution was not provided in the code, we used (if available) figures that had an axis with Reference SBP or DBP values, specifically correlation plots (Reference vs Estimated) and error plots (Reference vs Error). On the other hand, a Bland-Altman plot is not appropriate because the x-axis is the Average of the reference and estimated. Using these figures, we isolated the red, green or blue channels depending on the colors of the points of interest. Then, we sum the values along the non-reference axis, normalized them to attain a probability distribution function, fit a gaussian curve, and take the mean and standard deviation. The mean and standard deviation were reported as the BP distribution statistic. The implementation can be found at <em>__</em>. Finally, for studies that were included in our meta-analysis, we report the implementation availability and the dataset availability. For a description of parameters and their values, refer to <a href="/key/">Key</a>. Note: Because one author summarized all studies, there could have been bias in extracting the results.</p>

<h4> Summary Statistics </h4>

<p>We adopt an estimate to evaluate estimation accuracy for studies that perform subject level split, coined Explained Deviation (\(ED\)), used to compute the effectiveness of a device with estimation error parameterized by (\(\mu_\epsilon, \sigma_\epsilon\)) on a population parameterized by (\(\mu_{pop}, \sigma_{pop}\)), where \(\mu\) represents the mean and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation. The ED can be computed as \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sigma_\epsilon}\). The higher the ED, the better the device performs. On the other hand, an ED of 1 indicates that the estimator performs no better than an estimator that predicts a constant value. This is equivalent to an F-test for ratio of two variances with equal sample size, the null hypothesis \(H_0: ED \leq ED_{min}\), and the alternative hypothesis \(H_1: ED \gt ED_{min}\) where \(ED_{min}\) is the computed minimum Explained Deviation that meets the standards. Furthermore, confidence intervals can be computed using the F-distribution by determining the probability \(P(\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} &lt; ED_{true} &lt; \sqrt{F_{1-\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est})  = 1-\alpha\) where \(\alpha\) is the level of significance, \(P\) is the probability, \(F\) is the F-distribution, and \(n\) in the sample size.</p>

<p>Using the same formulation, we compute \(ED\) for personalization. However, in this case, we must take the change in BP of each subject into account: \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}}{\sigma_{\Delta BP}}\), where \(\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}\) is the change in BP prediction error of the study cohort and \(\sigma_{\Delta BP}\) is the standard deviation of the BP changes of the study cohort.</p>

<p>Moreover, we compute power (\(p\)) to determine whether the sample size is sufficient to detect the reported result. To do this we need to define selected level of significance, \(\alpha\), and \(\beta=1-p\). The ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2 requires device error to have an absolute mean and standard deviation within 5±8mmHg with \(\alpha=0.05\) and \(\beta=0.02\), corresponding to \(p=0.98\) and a sample size of 83. To compute this, they consider a two independent sample and continuous outcome study. The minimum sample size for a given \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is: \(n=2(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{ES})^2\) where \(ES\) is the effect size, \(z_{1-\alpha/2}\) is the z-score at \(1-\alpha/2\). Assuming \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), the minimum number of subjects for \(\alpha=0.05\) and \(p=1-\beta=0.98\) is 83. Conversely, the power of a study can be computed as \(p=1-\beta=\phi(ES \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}-z_{1-\alpha/2}))\) where \(ES\) (effect size) is given by error bias/error standard deviation \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), and \(\phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution. In this case, the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) is that the device has a mean difference and standard deviation of error above 5mmHg and 8mmHg. If the power is 0.98, that means that the probability of rejecting the \(H_0\) given the alternative hypothesis is true is greater than 98%.</p>

<h2> Results </h2>

<h4> Study selection </h4>
<p>We identified a total of 2510 articles from our database search and 29 articles from other sources. For inclusion in this analysis. After adjusting for duplicates by code, 2177 remained remained. We inspected the full articles and excluded 2008 unique articles and 36 additional studies (from articles that report multiple studies) based on the inclusion criteria. Likewise, we included 173 unique articles and 68 additional studies. From the 241 studies, we determined 94 studies performed subject level split and 147 studies performed personalization. Upon further examination, we identified the (change in) BP distribution of 61 and 9 studies for subject level split and personalization respecitvely. Ultimately, we included 70 studies in the meta-analysis. We provide a flow chart and statistics for extracted parameters in Fig. and Fig. respectively. See <a href="/search/">Search</a> for a complete list of studies and extracted parameters.</p>

<center> <i> Fig. . Extracted parameter statistics of meta-analysis included studies. Using the tabs above allows to switch between different extracted parameter distributions. Moreover, for categorical statistics, hovering over the bars shows the number of entries and percentage composition of subject level split and personalization studies. See <a href="/key/">Key</a> for a description of extracted parameters. </i> </center>
<p><br /></p>

<p>From Fig. ,for sensor data, we observe that the most common sensor data configuration used for BP estimation is photoplethysmography and photoplethysmography with electrocardiography. For algorithm, we observe that the most common class of algorithm used is classical machine learning, often in conjuntion with hand-crafted features. For subject characteristics, overall, we observe that there is a similar split between using healthy, diseased and a mix of healthy and diseased subjects in the study. However, it is notable that there were significantly less studies that used diseased subjects for personalization. For datasets used, we observe that an overwheming number of studies used databases collected internally that are not avaialble for the public and the most common publically available database used is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC). For study characteristics, we observe that the majority of subject level split studies were observational. On the other hand, we observe that the personalization studies were split similarly between observational and interventional studies. For the quantitative metrics, notably, the standard devation of the BP distribution for SBP is larger than that for DBP and the standard deviation of the BP distribution of subject level split studies is greater than that of personalization studies.</p>

<h2> Meta-Analysis (in progress) </h2>
<p>Using our proposed metric to evaluate estimation accuracy, we plot the ED of SBP versus ED of DBP for subject level split and personalization studies. We indicate the size of points using the power of the study and also report important study information using a hover tool. Moreover, we delineate in green the minimum ED (\(ED_{min}\)), computed from the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards for SBP and DBP, which were 2.42 and 1.46 respectively. See <a href="/standards/">Standards</a> for more information about the calculation.</p>

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 Mean local PTT versus brachial systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP obtained from both sitting \u2026 Therefore, such probes are not applicable for wearable and continuous monitoring \u2026","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","Hypertension has become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society.

In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.

Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively.

The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values.

This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.","\u2026 , comfortable, and wearable BP measurements system is \u2026 non-invasive and cuff-less BP measurement emerged in the \u2026 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 increased or decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SP and DP) \u2026 below) were available to estimate the BP change prediction model\u2026 We specifically estimated 32 models using data from all \u2026","\u2026 to predict systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 SeismoWatch: wearable cuffless blood pressure monitoring \u2026 Cuffless and non-invasive systolic blood pressure estimation \u2026","\u2026 to predict systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 SeismoWatch: wearable cuffless blood pressure monitoring \u2026 Cuffless and non-invasive systolic blood pressure estimation \u2026","NaN","\u2026 developed a wearable armband, capable of recording \u2026 In this study, estimation of the calibration curve required monitoring \u2026 Cuff-less and noninvasive measurements of arterial blood \u2026","\u2026 developed a wearable armband, capable of recording \u2026 In this study, estimation of the calibration curve required monitoring \u2026 Cuff-less and noninvasive measurements of arterial blood \u2026","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance.

This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 Since a future goal to is to enable such computation on a wearable where processing \u2026 into a wearable device.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

<p>We observe that there are 20 subject level split studies and 0 personalization studies that report an \(ED\) that exceed \(ED_{min}\) for both SBP and DBP. Moreover, we further narrow the criteria to studies that exceed \(ED_{min}\) with 95% confidence and exceed a power of 0.98. To do this, we recompute the 90% margin of error (\(MOE_{90}\)), since the margin of error is computed on both sides of the distribution, and compute \(ED_{min} - MOE_{90}\) to get the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the study. For brevity, this is called Explained Deviation SBP/DBP Lower Bound in Fig. . This ensures that there is a 95% probability that the true mean of the computed \(ED\) is above \(ED_{min}\).</p>

<p>From Fig. , we observe the only 6 studies (all performing subject level split) that exceed \(ED_{min}\) with 95% confidence and a power of 0.98. The Sensor Data are evenly distiributed between ECG+PPG and PPG with one ECG+PPG study that also uses biometrics. Similarly, the algorithm used is evenly distributed between classical ML and deep learning methods.</p>

<h4> Insight 1: Most studies suffer from Data Leakage </h4>

<p>Whether concious or unconcious, x% of the studies suffer from high bias in algorithm design, specifically in data leakage. This may be a result of publication bias, in which only the studies with good results are published. In particular, studies that perform record level split without personalization report incredibly low errors. Researchers need to take care in algorithm design to avoid these common pitfalls.</p>

<h4> Insight 2: Most studies do not produce statistically significant results </h4>

<h4> Insight 3: Lack of well designed personalization studies </h4>
<p>It is notable that less than 10% of the personalization studies include information about the change in BP distribution. Even though there are studies that report the initial BP distribution of subjects, this is not sufficient, as some experiments do not allow sufficient variation in BP. As a consequence, allowing the intial calibrated BP values to be the estimator can lead to small errors. In a similar vein, the number of observational studies and interventional type studies for personalization studies were almost equal. However, observational studies may not allow sufficient BP variation, leading to lower \(ED\). Due to the lack of longitudinal personalization studies that have high \(ED\), we suspect that longitudinal studies demonstrate device estimation accuracy no more than stable BP over the test period.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is also notable that even though there may be sufficient time between training and testing data, physiology may be the same. Therefore, it is essential to characterize these changes in physiologies. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8048484">Mukkamala et al., (2017)</a> discusses the maximum calibration period for acceptable error limits. However, this may only demonstrate when the physiology of a person changes so significantly that the PTT model estimation is outside the limits. Since the rate of physiological change is individually and temporally dependent, there is no one-size-fits-all maximum calibration period.</p>

<p>(show plot of MAE vs time)</p>

<p>Finally, it is worthwhile to note that even though Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) are considered considered as well-established features, there are no studies that demonstrate an \(ED\) that are greater or equal to \(ED_{min}\). To elaborate, there are no studies that involve the use of PTT that reported the change in BP distribution. All of the PAT and PTT studies cluster around the 1, with some that are below the error boundaries established by the standards. This may be due to poor study design or that the PTT model is too simple to represent the changing physiologies.</p>

<h4> Insight 4: Some studies do not have reproducible results </h4>
<p>It is important for a study to have reproducible results so the algorithms can be tested other datasets for validity. Not only do these algorithms include estimation models, they also include the data filtering algorithms that may shift the training and testing set distributions. Therefore, we implemented four studies that exceed \(ED_{min}\) and have sufficient power. Then, we benchmarked the data filtering algorithms and model combinations on publically available datasets. The implementation was done based on code provided (on GitHub) and/or the details of the algorithms presented in the paper. Based on the implemented <a href="/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, the claimed Explained Deviation for particular data filtering algorithm and model were not matched for the four algorithms selected. In fact, three of the four algorithms yielded an ED of 1. This may be a result of incomplete reporting and/or misleading reporting of specific details in the algorithms. Moreover, none of the benchmarked algorithms provided data filtering algorithms that allow users to download a dataset and perform operations such as detecting movement artifacts or poor quality signals.</p>

<p>Moreover, reproducibility is not only limited to software. Some studies involve using unconventional sensors. Based on our review, x% of studies that do not use PPG or ECG+PPG suffer from low power. The vast majority of high powered studies use one or more of the publicly available datasets. Although developing new devices is important for exploratory research, these devices are not verifiable by an external party. Furthermore, from <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Ioannidis (2005)</a>, the probability that a research finding is true (positive predictive value) is incredibly low for exploratory studies. In addition to transparent hardware, there needs to be more transparency in experimental protocols. For example, contact pressure is known to affect the waveform morphology. Since feature extraction techniques rely on the waveform morphology to detect key points, devices used in one study may not yield the same results without standardization of experimental protocols. Some studies may use a PPG sensor with a different spring constant.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it is integral for studies to be reproducible. Large flexibility in study design, definitions, and interpretation, allow for larger bias and therefore the less probability of true research findings. To tackle this, we provide templates for feature extraction machine learning pipelines, deep learning pipelines, and data visualization scripts to allow for more transparent reporting and streamlined testing. Every benchmark that will be reported on our website will follow a strict guideline on sharing code and reporting results. These can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/wearablebp/wearablebp_benchmarks">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<h4> Insight 5: Classical Machine Learning techniques benchmarked better that Deep Learning Techniques</h4>
<p>Based on the implemented <a href="/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, the only algorithm that produced an ED significantly greater than 1 was Hasandazeh et al. (2019), in which the authors extracted time-domain features (i.e. systolic upstroke time). This implies that either there are missing in studies that use deep learning algorithms or these details were misrepresented and there needs to be more effort into finding deep learning architectures that allow finding useful time-domain features.</p>

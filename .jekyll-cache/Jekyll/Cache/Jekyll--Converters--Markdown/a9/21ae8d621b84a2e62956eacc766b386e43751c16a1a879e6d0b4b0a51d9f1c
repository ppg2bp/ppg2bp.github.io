Common for the physiologic signals to be interrupted or changed occasionally during recordings of such long duration. </li> </ul>| {::nomarkdown}&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ideally, each MIMIC-III Waveform Database record should contain data from only one patient. All raw data files containing gaps of an hour or more have been split into separate records in order to decrease the likelihood that any record contains data from multiple patients data contains unspecified/unknown filtering delays and/or unknown inter-channel delays, which may not be constant in a given record. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Although the ECGs are time-aligned with each other, there may be a (changing) delay of up to 500ms between any of the other waveforms in the data. So PTT measured between different waveforms may be unreliable (either in absolute or relative terms). &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;
Due to downsampling of ECG signals, intervals vary between 2 and 14 ms (averaging 8 ms). Although ECGs reconstructed in this way can be readily interpreted visually, they are unsuitable as input for certain algorithms for ECG analysis, particularly those that are sensitive to frequency-domain features of the signal.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>

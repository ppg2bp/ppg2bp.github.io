<p>While other review papers have used common metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and percent error, these cannot be applied due to the large heterogeneity in datasets, devices, and algorithms used in each study. For example, a study with a dataset with small BP distribution may yield better results, as there is less variation that the model needs to explain. Here, we provide a brief summary of the statistics to account for heterogeneity in dataset distributions and calibration technique between studies and provide analysis with interactive visuals. For specific details related to methodology, see <a href="/methods/">Methods</a> and our <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=10">paper</a>. Please see the Wearable BP on <a href="https://github.com/wearablebp/">GitHub</a> for code to reproduce Systematic Review results and visuals. To access the raw data used in our systematic review, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/3g2yTkPNVmJFB2it6">form</a>.</p>

<h2> Metadata Statistics </h2>

<p>To understand the distribution of extracted parameters for the studies included in our Systematic Review, we visualize the distribution of the different study parameters. For categorical statistics, hovering over the bars shows the number of entries and percentage composition of subject split and personalization studies across categories. See <a href="/key/">Key</a> for a description of extracted parameters.</p>

<h3> BP Distribution is a confounding factor in BP Error </h3>

<p>To determine whether the BP distribution affects the error we regress the standard deviation of the errors on the standard deviation of the BP distributions. We find that lower error is harder to achieve for larger BP distributions and confirms that BP distribution is a confounding factor in accuracy for subject split. Therefore, we must take BP distribution into account in analysis. We suspect that the relationship is insignificant in personalization due to insufficient number of studies.</p>

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["deep learning"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Cao et al."],"BP Distribution":["110\u00b126.1; 69.3\u00b115.1"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#6a3d9a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 69.3\u00b115.1"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"MzMzMzMzLkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"BMJiknqGAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"F8HI7j179z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"Ir/hXX5CB0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"Lb36zL4J5z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"PQrXo3A9HUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.67\u00b17.31"],"DOI":["10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"Dataset":["Internal+MIMIC"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAgdkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Cao et al.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

and noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure is of vital importance in critical care. Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP. RMS error, measured by leave-one-out method, reduced from 8.45 mm Hg to 5.77 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.67 mm Hg to 6.90 mm Hg for MAP."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Rasool et al."],"BP Distribution":["107\u00b18.62"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ff7f00"],"DBP Distribution Raw":["NaN"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQrXHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b17.71"],"DOI":["10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAABgbEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Rasool et al.

assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP.

medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAkQAAAAAAAACRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAiQAAAAAAAACJA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Selvaraj et al.","Sung et al.","Sung et al."],"BP Distribution":["120.19\u00b17.95; 68.23\u00b17.37","138\u00b120; 70\u00b110","20.0\u00b112.9; 0.4\u00b15.4"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAADRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D9mZmZmZmb+P2ZmZmZmZv4/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 68.23\u00b17.37"," 70\u00b110"," 0.4\u00b15.4"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"exSuR+F6HUAAAAAAAAAkQJqZmZmZmRVA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"cT0K16Nw9T9almVZlmX5P1uplVqpleo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"z46Eb5xL6D+73sYutiHzPwERihvGBuQ/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"oYlC35PrAkAJ+DJ9WNsAQGtja8orpfE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"2svChlmx6T+uIj6X9SndP6prmfIih84/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFkAzMzMzMzMZQAAAAAAAABpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.6\u00b15.5"," 7.3\u00b16.3"," 4.4\u00b16.5"],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","10.1038/ajh.2011.259","10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"Dataset":["Internal","Internal","Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAzQAAAAAAAADNA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAge0AAAAAAAEB5QAAAAAAAQHlA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Selvaraj et al.

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAkQAAAAAAAACRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAiQAAAAAAAACJA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Selvaraj et al.","Sung et al.","Sung et al."],"BP Distribution":["120.19\u00b17.95; 68.23\u00b17.37","138\u00b120; 70\u00b110","20.0\u00b112.9; 0.4\u00b15.4"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAADRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D9mZmZmZmb+P2ZmZmZmZv4/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 68.23\u00b17.37"," 70\u00b110"," 0.4\u00b15.4"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"exSuR+F6HUAAAAAAAAAkQJqZmZmZmRVA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"cT0K16Nw9T9almVZlmX5P1uplVqpleo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"z46Eb5xL6D+73sYutiHzPwERihvGBuQ/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"oYlC35PrAkAJ+DJ9WNsAQGtja8orpfE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"2svChlmx6T+uIj6X9SndP6prmfIih84/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFkAzMzMzMzMZQAAAAAAAABpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.6\u00b15.5"," 7.3\u00b16.3"," 4.4\u00b16.5"],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","10.1038/ajh.2011.259","10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"Dataset":["Internal","Internal","Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAzQAAAAAAAADNA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAge0AAAAAAAEB5QAAAAAAAQHlA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Selvaraj et al.

the systolic blood pressure (SBP) has a strong correlation with PTT, and the diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 using seismocardiogram in a wearable blood pressure monitor,\u201d in Engineering in \u2026","Cuffless technologies provide a convenient platform for remote and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

and non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (BP) is of great importance particularly for patients in critical state. To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

and noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure is of vital importance in critical care. Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique.

been widely investigated for noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement. The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAkQAAAAAAAACRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAiQAAAAAAAACJA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Selvaraj et al.","Sung et al.","Sung et al."],"BP Distribution":["120.19\u00b17.95; 68.23\u00b17.37","138\u00b120; 70\u00b110","20.0\u00b112.9; 0.4\u00b15.4"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAADRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D9mZmZmZmb+P2ZmZmZmZv4/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 68.23\u00b17.37"," 70\u00b110"," 0.4\u00b15.4"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"exSuR+F6HUAAAAAAAAAkQJqZmZmZmRVA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"cT0K16Nw9T9almVZlmX5P1uplVqpleo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"z46Eb5xL6D+73sYutiHzPwERihvGBuQ/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"oYlC35PrAkAJ+DJ9WNsAQGtja8orpfE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"2svChlmx6T+uIj6X9SndP6prmfIih84/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFkAzMzMzMzMZQAAAAAAAABpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.6\u00b15.5"," 7.3\u00b16.3"," 4.4\u00b16.5"],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","10.1038/ajh.2011.259","10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"Dataset":["Internal","Internal","Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAzQAAAAAAAADNA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAge0AAAAAAAEB5QAAAAAAAQHlA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Selvaraj et al.

medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

and non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (BP) is of great importance particularly for patients in critical state. To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

and non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (BP) is of great importance particularly for patients in critical state. To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

pressure measurement can enable increased user adoption of regular monitoring and early intervention for hypertension, which is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Narasimhan et al."],"BP Distribution":["128.9\u00b110.2; 85.7\u00b18.7"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ffffb3"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 85.7\u00b18.7"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"ZmZmZmZmIUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"K77iK77i8z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"OLbO8FxA6z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"XtaJA5AF/T8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"hPZEFsPK3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" -3.2\u00b17.0 "],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACgYEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Narasimhan et al.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["deep learning"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Cao et al."],"BP Distribution":["110\u00b126.1; 69.3\u00b115.1"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#6a3d9a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 69.3\u00b115.1"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"MzMzMzMzLkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"BMJiknqGAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"F8HI7j179z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"Ir/hXX5CB0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"Lb36zL4J5z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"PQrXo3A9HUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.67\u00b17.31"],"DOI":["10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"Dataset":["Internal+MIMIC"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAgdkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Cao et al.

an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

Measuring an accurate blood pressure (BP) in ambulatory patients is critical for therapeutic decisions. An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.

Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

the systolic blood pressure (SBP) has a strong correlation with PTT, and the diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 using seismocardiogram in a wearable blood pressure monitor,\u201d in Engineering in \u2026","Cuffless technologies provide a convenient platform for remote and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP. This study shows that the proposed method provided a potential novel insight for the cuff-less BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 estimates systolic and diastolic blood pressure using features of PPG and ECG.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

\u2026","Cuffless technologies provide a convenient platform for remote and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

has become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values.

Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

and painless blood pressure measurement can enable increased user adoption of regular monitoring and early intervention for hypertension, which is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Narasimhan et al."],"BP Distribution":["128.9\u00b110.2; 85.7\u00b18.7"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ffffb3"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 85.7\u00b18.7"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"ZmZmZmZmIUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"K77iK77i8z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"OLbO8FxA6z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"XtaJA5AF/T8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"hPZEFsPK3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" -3.2\u00b17.0 "],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACgYEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Narasimhan et al.

<center> <i> Fig. 2. Regression plots for Standard Deviation of BP Distributions vs Standard deviation of Errors for SBP (left) and DBP (right) personalization studies. The points are color-coded by sensor device configuration. The size represents the power of the study. We report the slope, its confidence interval ([0.025, 0.975]), and its corresponding p-value (* indicates significant: p&lt;0.05) in legend inside the subplot. The green region bounds the maximum error and the minimum BP distribution as specified and estimated from AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-2:2019. Hovering over the scatter points displays important parameter information related to the study. Clicking the legend allows to show or hide particular sensor data configurations. Finally, panning, zooming, tapping, resetting, and hovering tools are included on the right hand side of the legend. See <a href="/key/">Key</a> for a description of extracted parameters. </i> </center>

<h3> Time between calibration and test vs Error Distribution </h3>

<p>To determine whether the accuracy of the personalization changes over time, we regress the error on the time between calibration and test (∆t). For this, the time increments were binned into seconds (∆t=[0, 1)), minutes (∆t=[1, 2)), hours (∆t=[2, 3)), days (∆t=[3, 4)), and months (∆t=[4, 5)). Based on the number of intervals between each bin, we assign each ∆t to a value in the interval. For example, 2 weeks (14 days) will have a value of 3+14/30=3.47 because there are approximately 30 days in each month.</p>

However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

non-invasive and cuff-less method to measure blood pressure (BP). \u2026 long-term monitoring, which requires a portable device. \u2026 Togawa, \u201cContinuous estimation of systolic blood pressure \u2026","Objective: Recently, a cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement device using pulse transit time (PTT) for beat-to-beat calculation of BP values has been validated over a short time period. However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively. Conclusion: In clinical practice over 24\u2009hours, there was a significant difference between the TestBP and RefBP with higher systolic and diastolic BP measured with the cuffless PTT device. Reasons for this difference need to be investigated.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03493867","The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2].

The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland\u2013Altman plots (n\u2009=\u2009105 paired BP readings).

However, it is still impractical in large-scale clinical application due to the concern of BP measurement accuracy.

By investigating the PTT and BP on 74 critically ill patients with AF, we found that parameters including PTT, R-R interval and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly changed when AF occurs, while the systolic BP (SBP) value and photoplethysmography intensity ratio (PIR) changed little. Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship. But the PIR would still be a predictive factor for BP estimation for AF patients.","\u2026 estimate the two extreme values of BP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 By using a low-power consumption wearable prototype made by SmartCardia, we \u2026","\u2026 of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques.

cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

Maisense Inc., Zhubei, Taiwan). The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2). These data suggest that this prototype cuffless BP monitor provides valid self-measurements in the vast majority of adults, and satisfies the BP measurement accuracy criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 2013 validation protocol."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2016.101"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["N.

However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively. Conclusion: In clinical practice over 24\u2009hours, there was a significant difference between the TestBP and RefBP with higher systolic and diastolic BP measured with the cuffless PTT device.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality.

The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2].

The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg).

The \u2026","Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended to improve the management of hypertension. Here, we investigated the accuracy of BP estimated using a wearable cuff-less device, InBodyWATCH, compared with BP measured using a manual sphygmomanometer. Thirty-five adults were enrolled (age 57.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 years). The BP was estimated using InBodyWATCH with an individualized estimation based on a neural network model. Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland\u2013Altman plots (n\u2009=\u2009105 paired BP readings). The correlations for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) between the two devices were high (r\u2009=\u20090.964 and 0.939, both P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The mean difference was 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 mmHg for SBP and \u22120.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 mmHg for DBP; these were not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.472 for SBP and P\u2009=\u20090.880 for DBP). The proportions of estimated SBP/DBP obtained from the InBodyWATCH within\u2009\u00b1\u20095 mmHg of manual SBP/DBP were 71.4%/83.8%; within\u2009\u00b1\u200910 mmHg they were 86.7%/98.1%; and within\u2009\u00b1\u200915 mmHg they were 97.1%/99.0%. The estimated BP from this wearable cuff-less device correlated highly with the manual BP and showed good accuracy, suggesting its potential to be used in ambulatory BP monitoring.","NaN","Pulse transit time (PTT) based continuous cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring has attracted wide interests owing to its potential in improving the control and early prevention for cardiovascular diseases. However, it is still impractical in large-scale clinical application due to the concern of BP measurement accuracy. Since such approach strongly relies on the PTT-BP model under certain theoretical assumptions, the accuracy would be affected by the vessel properties alterations induced by cardiovascular disorders. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases which often coexist with hypertension. The present study sought to examine the Impact of AF on the PTT and BP\uff0c validate the capability of PTT based cuff-less methods on AF patients. By investigating the PTT and BP on 74 critically ill patients with AF, we found that parameters including PTT, R-R interval and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly changed when AF occurs, while the systolic BP (SBP) value and photoplethysmography intensity ratio (PIR) changed little. Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship. But the PIR would still be a predictive factor for BP estimation for AF patients.","\u2026 estimate the two extreme values of BP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 By using a low-power consumption wearable prototype made by SmartCardia, we \u2026","\u2026 of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques.

most common form of blood pressure (BP) monitoring outside of clinical settings is an oscillometric cuff; however, such cuffs tend to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures. Our work allows the user to passively monitor BP during common weighing scale measurement, potentially improving the ease of longitudinal at-home care."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2960063"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Andrew M.

However, it remains unknown how values obtained with this device compare with standard ambulatory measurements over a 24-hour period. We hypothesised that BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device (TestBP) are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device (RefBP) in clinical practice over 24\u2009hours. Methods: Between May and December 2017, 71 individuals were prospectively included. Cuffless using the Somnotouch-NIBP (Somnomedics GmbH, Randersacker, Germany) and cuff-based standard 24-hour BP measurements were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm, respectively. The first RefBP measurement was used as calibration measurement for the TestBP. Results: Mean (\u00b1SD) age was 49.3 (15.1) years, and 51% were male. Mean 24-hour BP for TestBP and RefBP were 140.8 (20.0) versus 134.0 (17.3) mm Hg for systolic (p&lt;0.0001) and 85.8 (14.1)versus79.3 (11.7) mm Hg for diastolic (p&lt;0.0001) measurements, respectively. Mean absolute systolic and diastolic disagreements between TestBP and RefBP were 10.2 (7.2) and 8.2 (5.5) mm Hg, respectively. The number (percentage) of absolute differences between the mean 24-hour BP values of the TestBP and RefBP within 5, 10 and 15\u2009mm Hg were 23 (32.4), 43 (60.6) and 54 (74.6) for systolic and 24 (33.8), 51 (71.8) and 65 (91.6) for diastolic measurements, respectively. Conclusion: In clinical practice over 24\u2009hours, there was a significant difference between the TestBP and RefBP with higher systolic and diastolic BP measured with the cuffless PTT device.

However, it is still unknown how values obtained with a new cuffless device compare with standard ambulatory measurements in children. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether BP values measured by a cuffless PTT device are comparable with measurements by a standard upper arm cuff-based BP device. Methods Thirty children were prospectively included. Blood pressure measurements using the cuffless device (Somnotouch-NIBP) and cuff-based standard device (Omron 907) were performed simultaneously on the left and right arm. Results Mean systolic BP of the standard measurements was 123,47 \u00b1 14,91 mmHg and 127,48 \u00b1 15,98 mmHg (p &lt; .001) measured by cuffless method. Mean diastolic BP of the standard ABPM measurements was 66,88 \u00b1 11,86 mmHg and 68,52 \u00b1 12,36 mmHg (p &lt; .001). There were significant positive correlations between standard and cuffless measurements. Conclusion The results show that the created PWV\u2013BP function produces a significant correlation between BP derived from the PWV and the SBP measured by sphygmomanometry. When applying this device in clinical practice, one may keep in mind that the reported mean values over 24 hours, awake and asleep time are not directly interchangeable with cuff-based standard 24-hour BP values. The measured BP values were higher by the new technique. Although differences in SBP between both methods reached values up to 20 mmHg, we think that the development of a cuffless BP monitoring system will provide novel solutions in various medical situations.","Background Wearable continuous monitoring biosensor technologies have the potential to transform postoperative care with early detection of impending clinical deterioration. Objective Our aim was to validate the accuracy of Cloud DX Vitaliti continuous vital signs monitor (CVSM) continuous noninvasive blood pressure (cNIBP) measurements in postsurgical patients. A secondary aim was to examine user acceptance of the Vitaliti CVSM with respect to comfort, ease of application, sustainability of positioning, and aesthetics. Methods Included participants were \u226518 years old and recovering from surgery in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We targeted a maximum recruitment of 80 participants for verification and acceptance testing. We also oversampled to minimize the effect of unforeseen interruptions and other challenges to the study. Validation procedures were according to the International Standards Organization (ISO) 81060-2:2018 standards for wearable, cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices. Baseline BP was determined from the gold-standard ICU arterial catheter. The Vitaliti CVSM was calibrated against the reference arterial catheter. In static (seated in bed) and supine positions, 3 cNIBP measurements, each 30 seconds, were taken for each patient with the Vitaliti CVSM and an invasive arterial catheter. At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. Results The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were \u20130.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). Conclusions We found that the Cloud DX\u2019s Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03493867; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03493867","The current blood pressure (BP) measurement devices are mostly built on the principle of auscultation, oscillometry or tonometry, all of which use an inflatable cuff to occlude or unload the artery. The need of a cuff in these devices limits the further reduction in size and power consumption, and restricts the frequency and ease of their usage. Therefore, this study aims to develop a cuff-less and noninvasive technique for measuring BP by pulse transit time. The technique was evaluated on 85 subjects, aged 57plusmn29 yrs., including 36 males and 39 hypertensives, over an average period of 6.4 wks. A total of 999 pairs of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations were made. The average of BP readings reported by an experienced registered nurse and those obtained from a clinically approved automatic BP meter was used as reference. It is found that the estimated SBP and DBP differed from the reference BP by 0.6plusmn9.8 mmHg and 0.9plusmn5.6 mmHg respectively. When compared to the AAMI requirement (5plusmn8 mmHg for both SBP and DBP estimation), the results suggest that the cuff-less technology has great potential to be developed into wearable devices that are useful in self BP monitoring for home healthcare and eventually in clinical diagnosis","\u2026 measurement and ubiquitous usage especially in wearable \u2026 for cuff-less BP monitoring [1], [2]. Pulse transit time (PTT), \u2026 such as the systolic upstroke time, diastolic time, width of 2/3, 1/\u2026","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension. The pulse transit time (PTT) method has proven to be promising for continuous cuffless BP measurement. However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

However, the problem of accuracy is one of the most challenging aspects before the large-scale clinical application of this method. Since PTT-based BP estimation relies primarily on the relationship between PTT and BP under certain assumptions, estimation accuracy will be affected by cardiovascular disorders that impair this relationship and by the calibration frequency, which may violate these assumptions. This study sought to examine the impact of heart disease and the calibration interval on the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation. The accuracy of a PTT-BP algorithm was investigated in 37 healthy subjects and 48 patients with heart disease at different calibration intervals, namely 15 min, 2 weeks, and 1 month after initial calibration. The results showed that the overall accuracy of systolic BP estimation was significantly lower in subjects with heart disease than in healthy subjects, but diastolic BP estimation was more accurate in patients than in healthy subjects. The accuracy of systolic and diastolic BP estimation becomes less reliable with longer calibration intervals. These findings demonstrate that both heart disease and the calibration interval can influence the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation and should be taken into consideration to improve estimation accuracy.","Continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement without a cuff is advantageous for the early detection and prevention of hypertension.

The present cuff-based devices are intrusive for long-term BP monitoring, whereas cuff-less BP measurement methods based on pulse transit time or multi-parameter are inferior in robustness and reliability by using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram signals. This study examined a multi-sensor fusion-based platform and algorithm for systolic BP (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. The proposed multi-sensor platform was comprised of one ECG sensor and two pulse pressure wave sensors for simultaneous signal collection. After extracting 35 features from the collected signals, a weakly supervised feature selection method was proposed for dimension reduction because the reference oscillometric technique-based BP are intermittent and can be redeemed as coarse-grained labels. BP models were then established using a multi-instance regression algorithm. A total of 85 participants including 17 hypertensive and 12 hypotensive patients were enrolled. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach exhibited good accuracy for diverse population with an estimation error of 1.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.76 mmHg for SBP, 1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.03 mmHg for MAP, and 1.49 \u00b1 5.52 for DBP, which complied with the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation standards in BP estimation. Moreover, the estimation accuracy is with random daily fluctuations rather than long-term degradation through a maximum two-month follow-up period indicated good robustness performance. These results suggest that the proposed approach is with high reliability and robustness and thus provides a novel insight for cuff-less BP measurement.","Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) provides valuable information for cardiovascular risk assessment.

Access to the full waveform has significant advantages over previous cuffless BP estimation tools in terms of accuracy and access to additional cardiovascular health markers (e.g., cardiac output), as well as potentially providing arterial stiffness and identifying different cardiovascular diseases. Nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) are implemented using an artificial neural network to predict the BP waveforms using electrocardiography (ECG), and/or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals as inputs. The efficacy of the model is compared with a pulse arrival time (PAT) model using 15 subjects from the MIMIC II database. Two training modes are considered: training on the first eight minutes of data for each subject (Predictive training) and testing on the rest (up to 5.2 hours); and training on the first and the last eight minutes (Interval training) and testing the model in between. Predictive training and Interval training exhibited similar results initially, while Interval training resulted in higher accuracy over longer periods. The proposed method models the BP as a dynamical system leading to better accuracy in the estimation of SBP, DBP and MAP when compared to the PAT model. Moreover, the NARX model, with its ability to provide the BP waveform, yields more insight into patient health.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

The \u2026","Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended to improve the management of hypertension. Here, we investigated the accuracy of BP estimated using a wearable cuff-less device, InBodyWATCH, compared with BP measured using a manual sphygmomanometer. Thirty-five adults were enrolled (age 57.1\u2009\u00b1\u200917.9 years). The BP was estimated using InBodyWATCH with an individualized estimation based on a neural network model. Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland\u2013Altman plots (n\u2009=\u2009105 paired BP readings). The correlations for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) between the two devices were high (r\u2009=\u20090.964 and 0.939, both P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The mean difference was 2.2\u2009\u00b1\u20096.1 mmHg for SBP and \u22120.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 mmHg for DBP; these were not significant (P\u2009=\u20090.472 for SBP and P\u2009=\u20090.880 for DBP). The proportions of estimated SBP/DBP obtained from the InBodyWATCH within\u2009\u00b1\u20095 mmHg of manual SBP/DBP were 71.4%/83.8%; within\u2009\u00b1\u200910 mmHg they were 86.7%/98.1%; and within\u2009\u00b1\u200915 mmHg they were 97.1%/99.0%. The estimated BP from this wearable cuff-less device correlated highly with the manual BP and showed good accuracy, suggesting its potential to be used in ambulatory BP monitoring.","NaN","Pulse transit time (PTT) based continuous cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring has attracted wide interests owing to its potential in improving the control and early prevention for cardiovascular diseases. However, it is still impractical in large-scale clinical application due to the concern of BP measurement accuracy. Since such approach strongly relies on the PTT-BP model under certain theoretical assumptions, the accuracy would be affected by the vessel properties alterations induced by cardiovascular disorders. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac diseases which often coexist with hypertension. The present study sought to examine the Impact of AF on the PTT and BP\uff0c validate the capability of PTT based cuff-less methods on AF patients. By investigating the PTT and BP on 74 critically ill patients with AF, we found that parameters including PTT, R-R interval and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly changed when AF occurs, while the systolic BP (SBP) value and photoplethysmography intensity ratio (PIR) changed little. Further, by performing two cuff-less BP estimation method, we found that the estimated accuracy is decreased on PTT based method when AF occurs, but there is little change on PIR based method. The findings demonstrated that the impact of AF on PTT is significant, which would also influence the PTT-BP relationship. But the PIR would still be a predictive factor for BP estimation for AF patients.","\u2026 estimate the two extreme values of BP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 By using a low-power consumption wearable prototype made by SmartCardia, we \u2026","\u2026 of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure estimation significantly, which are superior to the state-of-the-art ML techniques.

compared a convenient, cuffless, wrist-type ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) device (BPro) and a standard arm-type ABPM monitor under ambulatory conditions. MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors. ConclusionThe wrist monitor showed fair agreement with the arm monitor in the ambulatory condition, and was stable irrespective of arm positions.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAyQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["none","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MBP.0b013e32835d124f","https://www.medtach.com/uploads/1/9/7/9/19798371/bpro_-_progress_on_the_development_of_the_mediwatch_ambulatory.pdf"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAADwPw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["T.

However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

However, conventional blood pressure measurement is unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to its discomfort and poor portability. Wearable device is an ideal solution to overcome this problem, which has attracted increasing interests of many researchers. While, high-performance wearable blood pressure sensor still remains a challenge. Here, we present a wearable blood pressure wristband system based on optical fiber. The end face of optical fiber was coated with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) + Ag composite diaphragm. The continuous and accurate measurement of the pulse waveform was achieved through the phase variation of the light reflected from the diaphragm. Then, the blood pressure can be estimated from the pulse transit time (PTT) which is extracted from the high-fidelity pulse waveform. The estimation model was established using data from 45 subjects. The clinical experiment was also carried out on 17 subjects to test the performance of the proposed wearable blood pressure wristband. The results show that the errors of systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are 0.24 \u00b1 2.39 mmHg and 0.12 \u00b1 2.62 mmHg compared with commercial sphygmomanometer, respectively.

However, conventional blood pressure measurement is unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to its discomfort and poor portability. Wearable device is an ideal solution to overcome this problem, which has attracted increasing interests of many researchers. While, high-performance wearable blood pressure sensor still remains a challenge. Here, we present a wearable blood pressure wristband system based on optical fiber. The end face of optical fiber was coated with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) + Ag composite diaphragm. The continuous and accurate measurement of the pulse waveform was achieved through the phase variation of the light reflected from the diaphragm. Then, the blood pressure can be estimated from the pulse transit time (PTT) which is extracted from the high-fidelity pulse waveform. The estimation model was established using data from 45 subjects. The clinical experiment was also carried out on 17 subjects to test the performance of the proposed wearable blood pressure wristband. The results show that the errors of systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are 0.24 \u00b1 2.39 mmHg and 0.12 \u00b1 2.62 mmHg compared with commercial sphygmomanometer, respectively. The measurement errors were within the required range of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) Grade A, which indicates that the blood pressure wristband has a good accuracy and practicability.

however, such cuffs tend to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures.

MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors. ConclusionThe wrist monitor showed fair agreement with the arm monitor in the ambulatory condition, and was stable irrespective of arm positions.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAyQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["none","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MBP.0b013e32835d124f","https://www.medtach.com/uploads/1/9/7/9/19798371/bpro_-_progress_on_the_development_of_the_mediwatch_ambulatory.pdf"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAADwPw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["T.

However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study. These results indicated that PPW obtained from the piezoelectric sensor has great feasibility for cuffless blood pressure estimation, and could serve as a promising method in home healthcare settings.","Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The new liquid\u2010capsule\u2010based sensor platform may help to realize an accurate, flexible, robust, and low\u2010power solution for next\u2010generation wearable health monitoring devices."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805045"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABxA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Xiangyu Fan, Y.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography (PPG)-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared to the standard cuff-based ABPM device.   METHODS 24H ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared to a cuff-based ABPM device.   RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5\u00b116.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mmHg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mmHg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mmHg for DBP and SBP respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared to the cuff-based device (p&lt;0.001).   CONCLUSIONS The cuff-less device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 measurements using a novel cuff-less photoplethysmography-based \u2026 This PPG-based wearable provides non-invasive, cuffless, \u2026 Recent estimates are that more than 800 million adults \u2026","\u2026 be integrated into portable or wearable devices in applications [\u2026 ), is considered for estimating blood pressures (BPs) based \u2026 -PD sensor module for cuffless blood pressure measurement \u2026","irrelevant; abstract According to the statistics of the World Health Organization, an estimated 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases each year, representing 31% of all global deaths. Continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) is essential for the management of cardiovascular diseases. However, it is difficult to achieve long-term CNAP monitoring with the daily use of current devices due to irritation of the skin as well as the lack of motion artifacts suppression. Here, we report a high-performance skin-like optoelectronic system integrated with ultra-thin flexible circuits to monitor CNAP. We introduce a theoretical model via the virtual work principle for predicting the precise blood pressure and suppressing motion artifacts, and propose optical difference in the frequency domain for stable optical measurements in terms of skin-like devices. We compare the results with the blood pressure acquired by invasive (intra-arterial) blood pressure monitoring for &gt;1500 min in total on 44 subjects in an intensive care unit. The maximum absolute errors of diastolic and systolic blood pressure were \u00b17/\u00b110 mm Hg, respectively, in immobilized, and \u00b110/\u00b114 mm Hg, respectively, in walking scenarios. These strategies provide advanced blood pressure monitoring techniques, which would directly address an unmet clinical need or daily use for a highly vulnerable population.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["proprietary","proprietary","proprietary","physiological model","physiological model","model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajh/hpab095","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73172-3","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8470924/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwaa022","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2020.3004032"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAoQAAAAAAAAPA/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Dean Nachman, Adi Gilan, N.

transit time (PTT) has been widely used for cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement. However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively. The BPs estimation errors satisfy the requirements of the IEEE standard 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, our method may be used for ubiquitous continuous BP monitoring."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tim.2021.3122182"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["M.

devices are rapidly evolving for long-term cardiovascular monitoring. However, most of the cardiovascular device requires multi-channel physiological signals acquisition, especially in continuous blood pressure (BP) measurement using pulse transition time (PTT) based methods. The multi-devices implementation could impede wearable applications. Objective: This study developed a wearable neck patch device using single-channel impedance plethysmography (IPG) sensing for cardiovascular monitoring, including continuous BP and heart rate (HR) measurement. Methods: IPG-based BP model was derived based on the Bramwell-Hill equation. A patch IPG device was designed and installed above the carotid artery of the subject neck. To validate the BP and HR functions of our device, the Bland-Altman plots were performed to evaluate the estimation error between the reference and the proposed devices within 20 healthy subjects. Results: The BP performance indicates that systolic BP (SBP) estimation error was \u22120.16 \u00b1 2.97 mmHg and 2.43 \u00b1 1.71 mmHg in terms of mean error (ME) and mean absolute error (MAE), and 0.09 \u00b1 3.30 mmHg and 2.83 \u00b1 1.68 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP) estimation. Moreover, the HR accuracy has the ME and MAE of 0.02 \u00b1 0.17 bpm and 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 bpm; mean percentage error (MPE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) obtained 0.04 \u00b1 0.23 % and 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 %. Based on statistical results, the BP and HR function of our device satisfied with AAMI/ANSI criteria below 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg and \u00b1 5 bpm or \u00b1 10%. Conclusion: This study implemented a wearable neck patch device with single-channel IPG acquisition that provided two significant cardiovascular parameters of continuous BP and HR, and its performance agreed with standard criteria based on validation with reference sensors. Significance: The proposed proof-of-concept IPG neck patch device has a high potential for wearable applications and low-cost manufacturing in cardiovascular monitoring.","\u2026 for blood pressure (BP) estimation in a wearable context: \u2026 On the other hand, PTT calculation requires at least two \u2026 performance in tracking systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (\u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAIQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["physiological model","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029604","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8857697/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Ting-Wei Wang, Hsiao-Wei Chu, Wen-Xiang Chen, Y.

however, such cuffs tend to be cumbersome and inconvenient. Less obtrusive systems requiring minimal effort from the user would allow for cardiovascular monitoring seamlessly in daily life and relieve much of the burden of regular blood pressure monitoring. In this work, we leverage the concept of pulse transit time (PTT) to track BP using a weighing scale-based system on which a subject simply stands quietly to obtain a measurement. To extract the proximal and distal timing references for PTT, a force plate measured the initial mechanical motion of the body in response to cardiac ejection while an optical sensor array mounted directly on the force place measured the pulse wave arrival at the sole. To evaluate the method, we recruited 16 young and healthy subjects. Seated and standing measurements first verified the effectiveness of the sensor array to extract a reliable distal timing reference. Then, subjects underwent various physiological perturbations to establish a correlation curve between measured BP and a best-case estimation of BP using PTT. By using the BCG and array of PPG sensors, PTT-estimated BP tracked changes well in diastolic ( ${r}={0.80} \\pm {0.12}$ ) and systolic ( ${r}={0.77} \\pm {0.23}$ ) pressures. This best-case estimation resulted in an error of 2.6 \u00b1 1.2 mmHg for diastolic and 5.6 \u00b1 2.7 mmHg for systolic pressures. Our work allows the user to passively monitor BP during common weighing scale measurement, potentially improving the ease of longitudinal at-home care."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2019.2960063"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Andrew M.

The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2). These data suggest that this prototype cuffless BP monitor provides valid self-measurements in the vast majority of adults, and satisfies the BP measurement accuracy criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 2013 validation protocol."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2016.101"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["N.

However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively. The BPs estimation errors satisfy the requirements of the IEEE standard 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, our method may be used for ubiquitous continuous BP monitoring."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tim.2021.3122182"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["M.

However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study. These results indicated that PPW obtained from the piezoelectric sensor has great feasibility for cuffless blood pressure estimation, and could serve as a promising method in home healthcare settings.","Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The new liquid\u2010capsule\u2010based sensor platform may help to realize an accurate, flexible, robust, and low\u2010power solution for next\u2010generation wearable health monitoring devices."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805045"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABxA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Xiangyu Fan, Y.

wrist-type ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) device (BPro) and a standard arm-type ABPM monitor under ambulatory conditions. MethodsFifty normotensive and prehypertensive volunteers who had no interarm differences in BP were enrolled. The wrist and arm monitors were attached to the left wrist and the right arm, respectively, and provided readouts at 15 and 30-min intervals, respectively. Ambulatory BP levels and the extent of agreement by intraclass correlation were evaluated. In 15 of the 50 participants, we also examined values at different arm positions: heart level, above the head, and hanging at the sides. ResultsThe awake mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (122\u00b113 vs. 127\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) were significantly lower with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor, and the mean sleep diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (71\u00b18 vs. 64\u00b18 mmHg, P&lt;0.01) was significantly higher with the wrist monitor than the arm monitor. The intraclass correlation values between the monitors were 0.54 for 24 h SBP and 0.52 for awake SBP, considered to indicate a moderate agreement. The BP values in the arm-raised position were significantly higher for the wrist monitor than for the arm monitor (SBP: 129\u00b114 vs. 108\u00b114 mmHg, P&lt;0.01; DBP: 83\u00b113 vs. 64\u00b111 mmHg, P&lt;0.01). However, the SBP and DBP values in the other arm positions were similar between the monitors. ConclusionThe wrist monitor showed fair agreement with the arm monitor in the ambulatory condition, and was stable irrespective of arm positions.","NaN"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAyQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["none","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MBP.0b013e32835d124f","https://www.medtach.com/uploads/1/9/7/9/19798371/bpro_-_progress_on_the_development_of_the_mediwatch_ambulatory.pdf"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAADwPw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["T.

However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control.

The smartphone app (RIVA digital) acquired the pulse wave in the fingers\u2019 arterial bed using the phone\u2019s camera and estimated BP based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position.

This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

Maisense Inc., Zhubei, Taiwan). The device estimates BP within 10\u2009s using three embedded electrodes and one force sensor that is applied over the radial pulse to evaluate the pulse wave. Before use, basic anthropometric characteristics are recorded on the device, and individualized initial calibration is required based on a standard BP measurement performed using an upper-arm BP monitor. The device performance in providing valid BP readings was evaluated in 313 normotensive and hypertensive adults in three study phases during which the device sensor was upgraded. A formal validation study of a prototype device against mercury sphygmomanometer was performed according to the American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization (ANSI/AAMI/ISO) 2013 protocol. The test device succeeded in obtaining a valid BP measurement (three successful readings within up to five attempts) in 55\u201372% of the participants, which reached 87% with device sensor upgrade. For the validation study, 125 adults were recruited and 85 met the protocol requirements for inclusion. The mean device-observers BP difference was 3.2\u00b16.7 (s.d.)\u2009mm\u2009Hg for systolic and 2.6\u00b14.6\u2009mm\u2009Hg for diastolic BP (criterion 1). The estimated s.d. (inter-subject variability) were 5.83 and 4.17\u2009mm\u2009Hg respectively (criterion 2). These data suggest that this prototype cuffless BP monitor provides valid self-measurements in the vast majority of adults, and satisfies the BP measurement accuracy criteria of the ANSI/AAMI/ISO 2013 validation protocol."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/jhh.2016.101"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["N.

However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control. The aim of this study was to compare a smartphone application (app)-based algorithm with office BPM (OBPM). (2) Methods: We included consecutive patients with an indication for ambulatory BPM. The smartphone app (RIVA digital) acquired the pulse wave in the fingers\u2019 arterial bed using the phone\u2019s camera and estimated BP based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms. Measurements were alternatingly taken with an oscillometric cuff-based device and smartphone BPM (AppBP) on two consecutive days. AppBP were calibrated to the first OBPM. Each AppBP was compared to its CuffBP (mean of the previous/following OBPM). (3) Results: 50 participants were included, resulting in 50 AppBP values on Day 1 and 33 on Day 2 after exclusion of 225 AppBP due to insufficient quality. The mean \u00b1 SD of the differences between AppBP and CuffBP was 0.7 \u00b1 9.4/1.0 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg (p-value 0.739/0.201) on Day 1 and 2.6 \u00b1 8.2/1.3 \u00b1 4.1 mmHg (p-value 0.106/0.091) on Day 2 for systolic/diastolic values, respectively. There were no significant differences between the deviations on Day 1 and Day 2 (p-value 0.297/0.533 for systolic/diastolic values). Overall, there were 10 (12%) systolic measurement pairs differing by &gt;15 mmHg. (4) Conclusions: In this pilot evaluation, the RIVA Digital app shows promising results when compared to oscillometric cuff-based measurements, especially regarding diastolic values. Its differences between AppBP\u2013CuffBP have a good stability one day after calibration. Before clinical use, signal acquisition needs improvement and the algorithm needs to undergo formal validation against a gold-standard BPM method.","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position. Differences for diastolic BP readings were respectively of 0.39\u2009\u00b1\u20096.86 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20091.93\u2009\u00b1\u20097.65 mmHg,\u2009\u2212\u20094.22\u2009\u00b1\u20096.56 mmHg and\u2009\u2212\u20094.85\u2009\u00b1\u20099.11 mmHg. This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Deploying this technology at a community level may be also useful to drive public health interventions against the epidemy of hypertension.","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions.

However, conventional blood pressure measurement is unsuitable for long-term monitoring due to its discomfort and poor portability. Wearable device is an ideal solution to overcome this problem, which has attracted increasing interests of many researchers. While, high-performance wearable blood pressure sensor still remains a challenge. Here, we present a wearable blood pressure wristband system based on optical fiber. The end face of optical fiber was coated with a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) + Ag composite diaphragm. The continuous and accurate measurement of the pulse waveform was achieved through the phase variation of the light reflected from the diaphragm. Then, the blood pressure can be estimated from the pulse transit time (PTT) which is extracted from the high-fidelity pulse waveform. The estimation model was established using data from 45 subjects. The clinical experiment was also carried out on 17 subjects to test the performance of the proposed wearable blood pressure wristband. The results show that the errors of systolic pressure (SBP) and diastolic pressure (DBP) are 0.24 \u00b1 2.39 mmHg and 0.12 \u00b1 2.62 mmHg compared with commercial sphygmomanometer, respectively. The measurement errors were within the required range of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) Grade A, which indicates that the blood pressure wristband has a good accuracy and practicability. This wearable and user-friendly optical fiber blood pressure monitor is a competitive alternative to current commercial products."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["physiological model"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2020.3027919"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Liangye Li, Yanpeng Li, Liuyang Yang, Fang Fang, Zhijun Yan, Qizhen Sun"],"BP Distribution":["NaN"],"BP Distribution Type":["unclear"],"Calibration Technique":["personalization"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAALEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ff7f00"],"DBP Distribution Raw":["NaN"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"9ihcj8L1BEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.12\u00b12.62"],"DOI":["10.1109/JSEN.2020.3027919"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["NaN"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAREA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Liangye Li, Yanpeng Li, Liuyang Yang, Fang Fang, Zhijun Yan, Qizhen Sun (2021)"],"ISSN":["NaN"],"Include":[1],"Issue":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Key Devices and Measurements":["fiber;

However, it requires more than one cardiovascular signal involving more than one sensing device. In this article, we propose a method for cuffless continuous blood pressure measurement with the help of left ventricular ejection time (LVET). A microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and then, the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic and diastolic BPs are estimated by calibrating the system with the original arterial BPs of the subjects. The performance evaluation is done using different statistical quantitative measures for the proposed method. The performance is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are measured from electrocardiogram (ECG)\u2013photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG\u2013PPG pairs. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the estimated BP is compared with the original one, measured through a reference system. It gives the mean errors of the systolic and diastolic BPs within the range of \u22120.197 \u00b1 3.332 and \u22121.299 \u00b1 2.578 mmHg, respectively.

However, this approach is inconvenient to deploy in wearable devices because two sensors are required for collecting two-channel physiological signals, such as electrocardiogram and pulse wave signals. In this study, we investigated the pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals collected from one piezoelectric-induced sensor located at a single site for cuffless blood pressure estimation. Twenty-one features were extracted from PPW that collected from the radial artery, and then a linear regression method was used to develop blood pressure estimation models by using the extracted PPW features. Sixty-five middle-aged and elderly participants were recruited to evaluate the performance of the constructed blood pressure estimation models, with oscillometric technique-based blood pressure as a reference. The experimental results indicated that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation errors for the estimated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 0.70 \u00b1 7.78 mmHg and 0.83 \u00b1 5.45 mmHg, which achieved a decrease of 1.33 \u00b1 0.37 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 1.14 \u00b1 0.20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure, compared with the conventional PTT-based method. The proposed model also demonstrated a high level of robustness in a maximum 60-day follow-up study. These results indicated that PPW obtained from the piezoelectric sensor has great feasibility for cuffless blood pressure estimation, and could serve as a promising method in home healthcare settings.","Pulse transit time (PTT) has received considerable attention for noninvasive cuffless blood pressure measurement.

In this paper, a wearable liquid\u2010capsule sensor platform embedded with a piezo\u2010resistive pressure sensor is presented for continuous, accurate, and alignment\u2010relaxed physiological monitoring, i.e., heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) tracking. The flexible capsule design ensures comfort and good device conformation to any skin regions. For HR and BP measurements, experiments are performed on 12 human subjects. The results show that the capsuled sensor can continuously track: 1) HR with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 0.88 beats per minute (bpm) and 2) BP with a MAD&lt;3 mmHg for both diastolic and systolic blood pressure. The new liquid\u2010capsule\u2010based sensor platform may help to realize an accurate, flexible, robust, and low\u2010power solution for next\u2010generation wearable health monitoring devices."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18124227","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/adfm.201805045"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABxA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[6]},"Authors":["Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Zeng-Ding Liu, Ji-Kui Liu, Bo Wen, Qing-Yun He, Ye Li, Fen Miao","Xiangyu Fan, Y.

of daily continuous blood pressure (DCBP) has a strong impact to realization of healthy society. However, existing methods to obtain blood pressure of cuff type and cuff-less types utilizing correlation with pulse waveform, pulse transit time or pulse rate; or computation of circulation model are not suitable to obtain DCBP. Here we implemented a method based on a simple circulatory system model using pulse rate measurement to overcome the limitations, and showed that it provides appropriate estimation of DCBP. The present model consists of a circulatory dynamic system model and an inverse model of a circulatory control system with input of pulse rate and six model parameters representing standard pulse rate, elasticity of systemic arteries, peripheral vascular resistance, and characteristics of resistance and stroke volume control. Validity of the DCBP estimation method was examined by preliminary experiment for one subject in four days and that for four subjects in one day. DCBP estimation was performed with 24-hour pulse rate measurement by a wearable device and sphygmomanometer measurement for parameter determination and verification. Mean absolute errors in systolic/diastolic pressures were appropriate ones for preliminary experiments with 9.4/6.4\u2009mmHg in four days and 7.3/5.9\u2009mmHg in five subjects.","Objective The objective of this study (NCT04027777) was to assess the accuracy and precision of the Aktiia Bracelet, a CE-marked noninvasive optical blood pressure (BP) monitor worn at the wrist, over a period of 1 month. Methods In this study, participants aged between 21 and 65 years were recruited. The clinical investigation extended the ISO81060-2:2013 standard to the specificities of cuffless devices. Each BP assessment consisted of the simultaneous recording of optical signals with Aktiia Bracelet and double-blinded auscultation by two trained observers in the standard sitting position. The algorithms of Aktiia Bracelet further processed the recorded optical signals to perform a signal quality check and to calculate uncalibrated estimates of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). These estimates were transformed into mmHg using a subject-dependent calibration parameter, which was calculated using the first two available reference measurements per subject. Results Eighty-six participants were included in the analysis. The mean and SD of the differences between Aktiia Bracelet estimates and the reference (ISO81060-2 criterion 1) were 0.46 \u00b1 7.75 mmHg for SBP and 0.39 \u00b1 6.86 mmHg for DBP. The SD of the averaged paired difference per subject (ISO81060-2 criterion 2) were 3.9 mmHg for SBP and 3.6 mmHg for DBP. Conclusion After initialization and during 1 month, the overall accuracy of Aktiia Bracelet satisfied validation criteria 1 and 2 of ISO81060-2 in the sitting position. The Aktiia Bracelet can be recommended for BP measurement in the adult population.","\u2026 In the absence of standards applicable to our cuffless approach, we evaluated the \u2026 of wearable cuffless blood pressure measuring devices and the objective performance evaluation of \u2026","(1) Background: New cuffless technologies attempting blood-pressure measurements (BPM) offer possibilities to improve hypertension awareness and control.

The smartphone app (RIVA digital) acquired the pulse wave in the fingers\u2019 arterial bed using the phone\u2019s camera and estimated BP based on photoplethysmographic (PPG) waveforms. Measurements were alternatingly taken with an oscillometric cuff-based device and smartphone BPM (AppBP) on two consecutive days. AppBP were calibrated to the first OBPM. Each AppBP was compared to its CuffBP (mean of the previous/following OBPM). (3) Results: 50 participants were included, resulting in 50 AppBP values on Day 1 and 33 on Day 2 after exclusion of 225 AppBP due to insufficient quality. The mean \u00b1 SD of the differences between AppBP and CuffBP was 0.7 \u00b1 9.4/1.0 \u00b1 4.5 mmHg (p-value 0.739/0.201) on Day 1 and 2.6 \u00b1 8.2/1.3 \u00b1 4.1 mmHg (p-value 0.106/0.091) on Day 2 for systolic/diastolic values, respectively.

Overall, there were 10 (12%) systolic measurement pairs differing by &gt;15 mmHg.

The vital signs data are processed and displayed on an OLED screen of the patient\u2019s wristwatch and sent the data over a wireless connection (Wi-Fi) and a Cloud Thing Board system, to store and manage the data in a data center. The data can be analyzed and notified to medical staff when abnormal signals are received from the sensors based on a set parameters from specialists. The proposed low-cost system can be used in a wide range of applications including field hospitals for asymptotic or mild-condition COVID-19 patients as the system can be used to screen those patients out of symptomatic patients who require more costly facilities in a hospital with considerably low expense and installation time, also suitable for bedridden patients, palliative care patients, etc. Testing experiments of a 60-person sample size showed an acceptable accuracy level compared with standard devices when testing with 60 patient-samples with the mean errors heart rate of 1.22%, systolic blood pressure of 1.39%, diastolic blood pressure of 1.01%, and body temperature of 0.13%. According to testing results with 10 smart devices connected with the platform, the time delay caused by the distance between smart devices and the router is 10 s each round with the longest outdoor distance of 200 m. As there is a short-time delay, it does not affect the working ability of the smart system. It is still making the proposed system be able to show patient\u2019s status and function in emergency cases.","Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = \u22120.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.","\u2026 used for cuffless, automated estimation of blood pressure because \u2026 systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure estimation \u2026 in different advanced wearable healthcare devices and \u2026","\u2026 higher than 0.95 for the systolic blood pressure (SBP) esti\u2026 for continuous cuffless arterial blood pressure measurement,\u201d \u2026 [29] Hyonyoung Han and Jung Kim, \u201cArtifacts in wearable photo\u2026","\u2026 To design a high-order filter in AFE circuitry for portable/\u2026 estimated known as 1/3\u00b7SBP + 2/3\u00b7DBP, where the SBP is systolic blood pressure while DBP is diastolic blood pressure\u2026","The diagnosis of hypertension and the adjustment of antihypertensive drugs are evolving from isolated measurements performed at the physician offices to the full phenotyping of patients in real-life conditions. Indeed, the strongest predictor of cardiovascular risk comes from night measurements. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a wearable device (the Aktiia Bracelet) can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions of daily life and thus become a candidate solution for the BP phenotyping of patients. We recruited 91 patients with BP ranging from low to hypertensive levels and compared BP values from the Aktiia Bracelet against auscultatory reference values for 4 weeks according to an extended ISO 81060-2 protocol. After initializing on day one, the observed means and standard deviations of differences for systolic BP were of 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20097.75 mmHg in the sitting position,\u2009\u2212\u20092.44\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15 mmHg in the lying,\u2009\u2212\u20093.02\u2009\u00b1\u20096.10 mmHg in the sitting with the device on the lap, and\u2009\u2212\u20090.62\u2009\u00b1\u200912.51 mmHg in the standing position.

This study demonstrates that a wearable device can accurately estimate BP in the most common body positions compared to auscultation, although precision varies across positions. While wearable persistent BP monitors have the potential to facilitate the identification of individual BP phenotypes at scale, their prognostic value for cardiovascular events and its association with target organ damage will need cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

<center> <i> Fig. 3. Regression plots for Time versus Standard Deviation for SBP (left) and DBP (right) personalization studies. The points are color-coded by sensor device configuration. The size represents the power of the study. We report the slope, its confidence interval ([0.025, 0.975]), and its corresponding p-value (* indicates significant: p&lt;0.05) in legend inside the subplot. The green region bounds the required error as specified by AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-2:2019. Hovering over the scatter points displays important parameter information related to the study. Clicking the legend allows to show or hide particular sensor data configurations. Finally, panning, zooming, tapping, resetting, and hovering tools are included on the right hand side of the legend. See <a href="/key/">Key</a> for a description of extracted parameters. </i> </center>

<p>Based on the regression lines, there is no significant relation between the accuracy of personalization studies and ∆t. However, it is interesting to note that visually, there is a faint increasing trend.</p>

<h3> Explained Deviation </h3>

<p>In addition to the performance criteria stated in the standards, we condition our performance metric based on the BP distribution, which is a significant source of heterogeneity between studies. To accomplish this, we adopt an interpretable statistic coined Explained Deviation (ED). For subject split, ED is used to compute the effectiveness of a device with estimation error parameterized by (\(\mu_\epsilon, \sigma_\epsilon\)) on a population parameterized by (\(\mu_{pop}\), \(\sigma_{pop}\)), where $\mu$ represents the mean and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation. The ED can be computed as \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sigma_\epsilon}\). The higher the ED, the better the system performs. On the other hand, an ED of 1 indicates that the estimator performs no better than an estimator that predicts a constant value. Intuitively, this statistic determines how much the model “explains” the BP distribution. Statistically, ED is similar to an F-test for the ratio of two variances with equal sample size, the null hypothesis \(H_0: ED \leq ED_{min}\), and the alternative hypothesis \(H_1: ED &gt; ED_{min}\) where \(ED_{min}\) is the computed minimum Explained Deviation that meets the standards (See Supplementary 1). One limitation of using ED is the assumptions of zero bias and normality, which are not always the case. However, this gives a good ballpark estimate in practice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we can compute confidence intervals using the F-distribution by determining the bounds \(P(\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} \leq ED_{true} \leq \sqrt{F_{1-\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est})  = 1-\alpha\) where \(\alpha\) is the level of significance, \(P\) are the probability, \(F\) is the F-distribution and \(n\) in the sample size (Supplementary 1). The Margin of Error is half the Confidence Interval. Using the same formulation, we compute ED for personalization. However, in this case, we must take the change in BP of each subject into account: \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}}{\sigma_{\Delta BP}}\), where \(\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}\) is the BP change error of the study cohort and \(\sigma_{\Delta BP}\) is the standard deviation of the BP changes of the study cohort. Finally, to determine whether the sample size is sufficient to detect the reported result, we compute power (\(p\)). To do this we define \(\alpha=0.05\), \(\beta=0.02\), and effect size \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), based on <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/aami/ansiaamiiso810602019">ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2019</a>. This corresponds to \(p=0.98\) and a sample size of approximately 85 (Supplementary 2).</p>

<h3> Estimating required Explained Deviation from AAMI/ANSI/ISO 81060-2:2019 </h3>

<p>The AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standard specifies that a device that for the general population should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have n=85 subjects, should include ≥30% males and ≥30% females</li>
  <li>Have ≥5% of the reference SBP readings ≤100 mm Hg, ≥5% with ≥160 mmHg, and ≥20% with ≥140 mmHg</li>
  <li>Have ≥5% of reference DBP readings ≤60 mmHg, ≥5% with ≥100 mmHg, and ≥20% with ≥85 mm Hg</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, there are no publicly available datasets that satisfy these demographics. However, the <a href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PPG-BP_Database_zip/5459299">PPG-BP</a> can meet these requirements if it is subsampled. To determine a subsample that satisfied the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards, we performed weighted sampling of subjects, where the weights were determined using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) marginalized on the requirements. We repeat this process 10000 times and determine the minimum variance of the subsampled datasets. Then, we took the maximum error standard deviation allowed by AAMI/ANSI/ISO (±8mmHg). The minimum ED for SBP and DBP was computed to be 2.17 and 1.39. The implementation can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wearablebp">Github</a>.</p>

<h3> DBP Explained Deviation vs SBP Explained Deviation </h3>

<p>Using our proposed metric to evaluate estimation accuracy, we plot the ED of SBP versus ED of DBP for subject split and personalization studies. We indicate the size of points using the power of the study and also report important study information using a hover tool. Moreover, we delineate in green the minimum ED (\(ED_{min}\)), computed from the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards for SBP and DBP, which were 2.17 and 1.39 respectively.</p>

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["deep learning"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Cao et al."],"BP Distribution":["110\u00b126.1; 69.3\u00b115.1"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#6a3d9a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 69.3\u00b115.1"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"MzMzMzMzLkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"BMJiknqGAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"F8HI7j179z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"Ir/hXX5CB0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"Lb36zL4J5z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"PQrXo3A9HUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.67\u00b17.31"],"DOI":["10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"Dataset":["Internal+MIMIC"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAgdkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Cao et al.

Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

is an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC. The mean prediction biases were \u22122.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.35, \u22123.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.35, and \u22123.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.69\u00a0mmHg for SAP, MAP, and DAP respectively.ConclusionsBP can be inferred from PPG using DBN-RBM modeling techniques. The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Regular monitoring of BP is thus important, but many people have aversion towards cuff-based devices, and their limitation is that they can only be used at rest. Using just a photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP is a potential solution investigated in our study. We analyzed the MIMIC III database for high-quality PPG and arterial BP waveforms, resulting in over 700 h of signals after preprocessing, belonging to 510 subjects. We then used the PPG alongside its first and second derivative as inputs into a novel spectro-temporal deep neural network with residual connections. We have shown in a leave-one-subject-out experiment that the network is able to model the dependency between PPG and BP, achieving mean absolute errors of 9.43 for systolic and 6.88 for diastolic BP. Additionally we have shown that personalization of models is important and substantially improves the results, while deriving a good general predictive model is difficult. We have made crucial parts of our study, especially the list of used subjects and our neural network code, publicly available, in an effort to provide a solid baseline and simplify potential comparison between future studies on an explicit MIMIC III subset.","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP

medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9101868/"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Yang et al.","Kilickaya et al.","Sen et al."],"BP Distribution":["127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11","127.95\u00b120.38; 71.85\u00b111.11"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABhA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAkAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#ffff99","#ffff99","#ffff99"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"," 71.85\u00b111.11"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"uB6F61E4JkC4HoXrUTgmQLgehetROCZA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"b4I2+LflAEAThN1XpufwP6XFS/W/6fo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"CsrS7FbA9T+ywfBa3PToPzL01yx2UvE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"1MyVMsxACkBWrwOH4Ob2P2dld8w+6ARA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"ns9YeEHB7j/6nBaz5NjUP5zWFmwHfug/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"CtejcD0KFUDioR4j1gclQPeVtRN8axpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0\u00b15.26"," 8.39"," 5.27"],"DOI":["10.1117/12.2502315","10.1109/hora49412.2020.9152602","NaN"],"Dataset":["PPG-BP","PPG-BP","PPG-BP"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9144309/9152597/09152602.pdf?arnumber=9152602","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9098743/9101408/09101868.pdf"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAQeUAAAAAAACBtQAAAAAAAiIBA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Yang et al.

and non-invasive measurement of blood pressure (BP) is of great importance particularly for patients in critical state. To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

and noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure is of vital importance in critical care. Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["deep learning"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Cao et al."],"BP Distribution":["110\u00b126.1; 69.3\u00b115.1"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#6a3d9a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 69.3\u00b115.1"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"MzMzMzMzLkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"BMJiknqGAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"F8HI7j179z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"Ir/hXX5CB0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"Lb36zL4J5z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"PQrXo3A9HUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.67\u00b17.31"],"DOI":["10.1145/3447993.3483241"],"Dataset":["Internal+MIMIC"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAgdkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Cao et al.

become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Wu et al."],"BP Distribution":["117\u00b117.3; 66.4\u00b19.8"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#e31a1c"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 66.4\u00b19.8"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZI0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"0UUXXXTREUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"WKzpIQOmBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"0a4L0GzAHkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"pdgWP2ttBEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"mpmZmZmZAUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 1.52\u00b12.20"],"DOI":["10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8966011"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAWkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Wu et al.

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP.

monitoring and early intervention for hypertension, which is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Narasimhan et al."],"BP Distribution":["128.9\u00b110.2; 85.7\u00b18.7"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ffffb3"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 85.7\u00b18.7"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"ZmZmZmZmIUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"K77iK77i8z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"OLbO8FxA6z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"XtaJA5AF/T8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"hPZEFsPK3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" -3.2\u00b17.0 "],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACgYEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Narasimhan et al.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAkQAAAAAAAACRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Algorithm":["classical ML","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAiQAAAAAAAACJA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Authors":["Selvaraj et al.","Sung et al.","Sung et al."],"BP Distribution":["120.19\u00b17.95; 68.23\u00b17.37","138\u00b120; 70\u00b110","20.0\u00b112.9; 0.4\u00b15.4"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAADRA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D9mZmZmZmb+P2ZmZmZmZv4/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"CitesURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Color":["#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7","#8dd3c7"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 68.23\u00b17.37"," 70\u00b110"," 0.4\u00b15.4"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"exSuR+F6HUAAAAAAAAAkQJqZmZmZmRVA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"cT0K16Nw9T9almVZlmX5P1uplVqpleo/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"z46Eb5xL6D+73sYutiHzPwERihvGBuQ/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"oYlC35PrAkAJ+DJ9WNsAQGtja8orpfE/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"2svChlmx6T+uIj6X9SndP6prmfIih84/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFkAzMzMzMzMZQAAAAAAAABpA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.6\u00b15.5"," 7.3\u00b16.3"," 4.4\u00b16.5"],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513211","10.1038/ajh.2011.259","10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"Dataset":["Internal","Internal","Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAzQAAAAAAAADNA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAge0AAAAAAAEB5QAAAAAAAQHlA","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]},"Hover Title":["Selvaraj et al.

blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Narasimhan et al."],"BP Distribution":["128.9\u00b110.2; 85.7\u00b18.7"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA9D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"CitesURL":["NaN"],"Color":["#ffffb3"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 85.7\u00b18.7"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"ZmZmZmZmIUA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"K77iK77i8z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"OLbO8FxA6z8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"XtaJA5AF/T8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"hPZEFsPK3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAHEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" -3.2\u00b17.0 "],"DOI":["10.1109/EMBC.2018.8513065"],"Dataset":["Internal"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN"],"FullTextURL":["NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACgYEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Hover Title":["Narasimhan et al.

the systolic blood pressure (SBP) has a strong correlation with PTT, and the diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 using seismocardiogram in a wearable blood pressure monitor,\u201d in Engineering in \u2026","Cuffless technologies provide a convenient platform for remote and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring, however, signal recordings employed for cuffless BP estimation, which are based on the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) signals, are frequently corrupted with measurement noise and artefacts. Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical. Many of the existing methods, however, are based on manual feature extraction, which cannot characterize the complex relationship between the physiological signals and BP. In this study, the 16-layer VGGNet was used to construct cuff-less BP from electrocardiogram (ECG) and pressure pulse wave (PPW) signals, with no need extract features from raw signals. The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical.

The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Algorithm":["deep learning","deep learning","classical ML","classical ML"],"ArticleURL":["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365719309674","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s18041160"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Authors":["Miao et al.","Miao et al.","Simjanoska et al.","Simjanoska et al."],"BP Distribution":["137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","137.07\u00b119.54; 73.42\u00b18.17","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76","128.31\u00b120.89; 71.97\u00b111.76"],"BP Distribution Type":["ME","ME","ME","ME"],"Calibration Technique":["subject split","subject split","subject split","subject split"],"CitationURL":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Cites":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAA+QAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerAuthor":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesPerYear":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAL0AAAAAAAAAvQAAAAAAAAClAAAAAAABAMEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"CitesURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10767753434235610339&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=16514862198638548625&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2007&amp;hl=en","NaN"],"Color":["#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a","#b2df8a"],"DBP Distribution Raw":[" 73.42\u00b18.17"," 73.42\u00b18.17"," 71.97\u00b111.76"," 71.97\u00b111.76"],"DBP Distribution STD":{"__ndarray__":"16NwPQpXIEDXo3A9ClcgQIXrUbgehSdAhetRuB6FJ0A=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED":{"__ndarray__":"z5f/3D3I9D+wF9ZdgUL3PwX0KdtxP/A/9etVq29/4D8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI LB":{"__ndarray__":"8m7hFzPm8j89TwVxBgzwP6740dqJP9I/Fc2Y0jjQzD8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED 95CI UB":{"__ndarray__":"t+BGkE/a9j/19pjKeNsAQIsOPS/57gxAbdK7mnbk8j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP ED MOE":{"__ndarray__":"KI4rw+Ogvz+tniwk66rhP3XP4vMHp/o/lXHRAN+U3j8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Error STD":{"__ndarray__":"KVyPwvUoGUB7FK5H4XoWQG78g15HKSdAyTJb9HDPNkA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"DBP Reported Error Raw":[" 0.01\u00b16.29"," -0.75\u00b15.62"," 9.24"," 18.20"],"DOI":["NaN","NaN","NaN","10.3390/s18041160"],"Dataset":["MIMIC","MIMIC+Internal","CHARIS","CHARIS"],"ECC":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAP0AAAAAAAAA/QAAAAAAAADlAAAAAAABAUEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"EndPage":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Evaluation Metric":["ME","ME","MAE","MAE"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Availability":["Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable","Unavailable"],"Exact Dataset/Pre-processing Code Link":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"Exclude Reason":["NaN","NaN","NaN","NaN"],"FullTextURL":["https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?output=instlink&amp;q=info:4ySbzLK-bpUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2007&amp;scillfp=15463049794767302444&amp;oi=lle","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156625351830767X","NaN"],"GSRank":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAACAckAAAAAAAIByQAAAAAAAaIBAAAAAAACAcEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]},"Hover Title":["Miao et al.

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device. The present study applied this novel method to a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (NBPM).   METHODS We enrolled 50 patients (37 men, age range 30-84 years) referred for cardiac catheterization. Invasive right brachial and central aortic pressures (using a dual-sensor pressure catheter), and noninvasive left brachial SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and PVP waveform (using a customized NBPM) were simultaneously recorded. Central SBP was estimated by analysis of the PVP waveform calibrated to the noninvasive SBP and DBP, using both the original (CSBP-O) and the newly generated (CSBP-N) regression equations. The reproducibility of the invasive central SBP by CSBP-O and CSBP-N was examined using the concordance correlation coefficient.   RESULTS Overall, the invasive central aortic SBP ranged 86-176 with a mean of 124 \u00b1 21 mm Hg. The mean differences between the estimated and the invasive central SBP were -1.3 \u00b1 6.7 mm Hg for CSBP-O and 0.0 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg for CSBP-N, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficients for CSBP-O and CSBP-N were 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.95-0.96), and both were significantly better than that for the noninvasive brachial SBP (0.87, 0.84-0.91) indicated by non-overlapping CIs.   CONCLUSIONS The PVP method for noninvasive estimation of central SBP can be applied to a commonly used NBPM. Whether the NBPM-derived central SBP is superior to the noninvasive brachial SBP in the prediction of cardiovascular risks remains to be investigated.","BACKGROUND Central systolic blood pressure (SBP) can be estimated by an oscillometric method developed from a pulse volume plethysmography (PVP) device.

<center> <i> Fig. 4. Scatter plots of DBP Explained Deviation versus SBP Explained Deviation for subject split (left) and personalization (right). The points are color-coded by sensor device configuration. The size represents the power of the study. We report the slope, its confidence interval ([0.025, 0.975]), and its corresponding p-value (* indicates significant: p&lt;0.05) in legend inside the subplot. The green region bounds the minimum required Explained Deviations estimated from ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2019. Hovering over the scatter points displays important parameter information related to the study. Clicking the legend allows to show or hide particular sensor data configurations. Finally, panning, zooming, tapping, resetting, and hovering tools are included on the right hand side of the legend. See <a href="/key/">Key</a> for a description of extracted parameters. </i> </center>

<h2> Supplementary 1: Explained Deviation Confidence Interval </h2>

<p>Assume:</p>
<ol>
  <li>\(n_1\) in dependent observations from a normally distributed popoulation with variance \(\sigma_1^2\) and</li>
  <li>\(n_2\) independent observations from a normall distributed population with variance \(\sigma_2^2\).</li>
</ol>

<p>Given sample variance \(s_1^2\) and \(s_2^2\), we can write \(\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2}{\sigma_1} \sim \chi_{n_1-1}^2\) and \(\frac{(n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{\sigma_2} \sim \chi_{n_2-1}^2\) <br /> The ratio of these two distributions is a F-distribution and can be written in the form \(F=\frac{s_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{s_2^2/\sigma_2^2}\) <br /> The \(1-\alpha\) confidence interval can be written as \(P(F_{\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1) \lt \frac{s_1^2/\sigma_1^2}{s_2^2/\sigma_2^2} \lt F_{1-\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1)\) <br /> Simplying the expression, using the identity \(F_{1-\alpha/2}(n_1-1, n_2-1) = \frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2}(n_2-1, n_1-1)}\), and substituting \(\frac{s_1}{s_2}=ED_{est}\) and \(\frac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2}=ED_{true}\) gives \(P(\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} &lt; ED_{true} &lt; \sqrt{F_{1-\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est})  = 1-\alpha\)</p>

<h2> Supplementary 2: Power Analysis </h2>

<p>Compute \(p=1-\beta=\phi(ES \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}-z_{1-\alpha/2}))\) where \(ES\) (effect size) is given by error bias/error standard deviation=\(\frac{5}{8}\), \(\alpha\) is the selected level of significance, \(\beta=1-P\), and \(\phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution</p>

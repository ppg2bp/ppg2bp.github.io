      <td><ul> <li> Common for the physiologic signals to be interrupted or changed occasionally during recordings of such long duration. </li> <li>Single record could contain data from data from multiple patients </li> <li> Unspecified/unknown filtering delays and/or unknown inter-channel delays, which may not be constant in a given record. </li> <li> ECGs are time-aligned with each other, but there may be a changing delay of up to 500ms between any of the other waveforms in the data. So PTT measured between different waveforms may be unreliable (either in absolute or relative terms). </li> <li> Due to downsampling of ECG signals, intervals vary between 2 and 14 ms (averaging 8 ms). Although ECGs reconstructed in this way can be readily interpreted visually, they are unsuitable as input for certain algorithms for ECG analysis, particularly those that are sensitive to frequency-domain features of the signal.</li> </ul></td>

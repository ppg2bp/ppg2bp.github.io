      <td><ul><li> Collected in a largely automated fashion, from all of the bedside monitors in certain adult and neonatal ICUs. </li> <li> Recorded waveforms and numerics vary depending on choices made by the ICU staff. </li> <li> Almost always include one or more ECG signals, and often include continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms, fingertip photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, and respiration, with additional waveforms (up to 8 simultaneously) as available, including heart and respiration rates, SpO2, and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure. </li> </ul></td>
      <td><ul> <li> Occasionally, technical limitations of the data acquisition system make it possible to create a physiologic waveform record but not a numerics record, or vice versa. </li> <li>Records vary in length; some are several weeks in duration. Common for the physiologic signals to be interrupted or changed occasionally during recordings of such long duration. </li> </ul></td>

<h2> Method </h2>

<h4> Protocol and Registration, Information Sources, and Search </h4>
<p>Keywords ‚Äúwearable‚Äù, ‚Äúblood pressure‚Äù, ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù, ‚Äúestimation‚Äù, ‚Äúsystolic‚Äù, ‚Äúdiastolic‚Äù, and ‚Äúcuffless‚Äù were entered into the search tool <a href="https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish">Publish or Perish</a> on 5/10/2022 which retrieves and analyzes academic citations from external data sources, including Crossref, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The Maximum number of results were specified as 1000 and the articles were specified in the time-frame of 1979-2022. Additional studies were included from Google Scholar alerts of ‚Äúblood pressure device‚Äù and from article references.</p>

<h4> Eligibility Criteria </h4>
<p>We develop an Eligibility Criteria to determine whether studies should be included or excluded from analysis. First, we include studies that report mean absolute error (MAE) or bias¬±standard deviation of error (ME) for Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure estimation. The AAMI/ANSI/ISO, BHS, and IEEE Standards all require either ME or MAE. Moreover, we can compute ME to MAE and vice versa (assuming zero bias) through a folded normal distribution. Second, we require the article to be written in the English language. Third, we only include studies that do not suffer from data leakage. In order to properly compare and contrast data, we must stratify by algorithmic level calibration technique. We coin the terms ‚Äúrecord level split without personalization‚Äù, ‚Äúsubject level split‚Äù, and ‚Äúpersonalization‚Äù to distinguish between calibration techniques. Record level split without personalization involves having data in the training and testing set from the same subjects, therefore suffering from data leakage. For example, randomly sampled segments from a subject are included in both the training and test set. Unfortunately there are currently no useful applications for the record level split without personalization calibration technique. On the other hand, Subject level split, which can be thought of as ‚Äúpopulation level calibration‚Äù, involves using different subjects in the training and testing sets. For example, if 100 subjects are in the dataset, 50 subjects are used for training the model and the other 50 are used for testing the model. In contrast, personalization, which can be thought of as ‚Äúindividual level calibration‚Äù, is a subset of record level split. This involves performing record level split with a temporal constraint, in which the training data is selected as the first portion of records and the testing data is selected as the latter portion of the record without overlap with the training data. For example, if a record for a single subject is 1 month long, data from the first day is used for training and the rest is used for testing. This individual level model is usually recalibrated at arbitrary intervals due to physiological changes that may render the model inaccurate. We only include articles that claim to perform subject level split or personalization. Fourth, we exclude models that dynamically update based on individual subjects and their time stamps. Fifth, we only include studies that perform experiments on human subjects, as we aim to deploy these devices on humans. Finally, we only include studies that have number of test subjects greater than 1 due to inability to compute blood pressure distributions of subject population. For studies that are not included, we provide a exclusion reason.</p>

<h4> Data Collection Process and Data Items </h4>

<p>A single author performed extraction of predefined data parameters. For studies that had multiple protocols and reported multiple results, the multiple entries were made in the compiled database. The predefined data fields include: Key Devices and Measurements, Calibration Technique, Algorithm,	Dataset, Number of Test Subjects, Training Subject Characteristics, Testing Subject Characteristics, Study Characteristics (observational or interventional study), BP Distribution, Evaluation Metric, and Reported Result. For personalization articles, we report the Time between Calibration and Test. Finally, for studies that were included in our meta-analysis, we report the implementation availability and the dataset availability. For a description of parameters and their values, refer to <a href="/key/">Key</a>. Note: Because one author summarized all studies, there could have been bias in extracting the results.</p>

<h4> Summary Statistics </h4>

<p>We propose a new estimate to evaluate estimation accuracy for studies that perform subject level split, Explained Deviation (\(ED\)), used to compute the effectiveness of a device with estimation error parameterized by (\(\mu_\epsilon, \sigma_\epsilon\)) on a population parameterized by (\(\mu_{pop}, \sigma_{pop}\)), where \(\mu\) represents the mean and \(\sigma\) represents the standard deviation. The ED can be computed as \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{pop}}{\sigma_\epsilon}\). The higher the EV, the better the device performs. On the other hand, an ED of 1 indicates that the estimator performs no better than an estimator that predicts a constant value.</p>

<p>Using the same formulation, we compute \(ED\) for personalization. However, in this case, we must take the change in BP of each subject into account: \(ED = \frac{\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}}{\sigma_{\Delta BP}}\), where \(\sigma_{\Delta BP, err}\) is the change in BP prediction error of the study cohort and \(\sigma_{\Delta BP}\) is the standard deviation of the BP changes of the study cohort.</p>

<p>Moreover, we compute the 95% Margin of Error (\(E_{95}\)) and power (\(P\)) to determine the uncertainty of the reported result. To do this we need to define selected level of significance, \(\alpha\), and \(\beta=1-P\). The ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2 requires device error to have an absolute mean and standard deviation within 5¬±8mmHg with \(\alpha=0.05\) and \(\beta=0.02\), corresponding to \(P\)=0.98 and a sample size of 83. To compute this, they consider a two independent sample and continuous outcome study. The minimum sample size for a given \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is: \(n=2(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2}+z_{1-\beta}}{ES})^2\) where \(ES\) is the effect size, \(z_{1-\alpha/2}\) is the z-score at \(1-\alpha/2\). Assuming \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), the minimum number of subjects for \(\alpha=0.05\) and \(P=1-\beta=0.98\) is 83. Conversely, the power of a study can be computed as \(P=1-\beta=\phi(ES \sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}-z_{1-\alpha/2}))\) where \(ES\) (effect size) is given by error bias/error standard deviation \(ES=\frac{5}{8}\), and \(\phi\) is the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution. In this case, the null hypothesis (\(H_0\)) is that the device has a mean difference and standard deviation of error above 5mmHg and 8mmHg. If the power is 0.98, that means that the probability of rejecting the \(H_0\) given the alternative hypothesis is true is greater than 98%.</p>

<h4> Study selection </h4>
<p>A total of 2095 articles were identified for inclusion in this analysis. After adjusting for duplicates, 1904 remained. Of these 1904 articles, 1703 articles were discarded after inspecting the full article because they did not meet the criteria or were review papers. The remaining 201 articles were examined in more detail. An additional 18 artiles from the references and citations of relevant articles were inspected and 11 were included. Inspecting 201 articles yielded 232 studies (some articles reported more than one study). See <a href="/search/">Search</a> for a complete list of studies and extracted parameters. A flowchart of the study selection is shown below.

abstract":["Convenient and painless blood pressure measurement can enable increased user adoption of regular monitoring and early intervention for hypertension, which is a significant cause of mortality worldwide. This paper introduces a fingerwearable blood pressure measurement device to enable frequent daytime and nocturnal monitoring. The blood pressure measurement is achieved using a two-dimensional capacitive tactile sensor array that is located next to a digital artery. A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure. A clinical study (N =97) was conducted to obtain training (N =49) and validation (N =19) data for blood pressure algorithm development and test (N =29) data to determine the estimation accuracy compared to brachial dual-observer auscultation. On the test set, the mean and standard deviation of the error in the systolic blood pressure estimate are 0.9 mmHg and 6.9 mmHg, respectively, while the corresponding quantities for diastolic blood pressure are \u22123.2 mmHg and 7.0 mmHg, respectively. These results compare favorably to blood pressure accuracy requirements specified by international standards."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]}},"selected":{"id":"1746"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1747"}},"id":"1708","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1836","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1300"},"glyph":{"id":"1331"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1332"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1334"}},"id":"1333","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1752","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1708"},"glyph":{"id":"1751"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1752"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1754"}},"id":"1753","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1392","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1332","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1708"}},"id":"1754","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1711","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1386","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1790"},"glyph":{"id":"1792"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1793"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1795"}},"id":"1794","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1300"}},"id":"1334","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1630"}},"id":"1674","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1358"},"glyph":{"id":"1360"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1361"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1363"}},"id":"1362","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1630"},"glyph":{"id":"1671"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1672"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1674"}},"id":"1673","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1751","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1671","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAJEAAAAAAAAAkQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML","Classical ML"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML; MLR","classical ML; MLR"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ajh.2011.259"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAIkAAAAAAAAAiQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Sung et al.","Sung et al."],"Authors raw":["S.

abstract":["BACKGROUND: Measuring an accurate blood pressure (BP) in ambulatory patients is critical for therapeutic decisions. An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

abstract":["Arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]}},"selected":{"id":"1450"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1451"}},"id":"1420","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1633","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAADwPw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML","Classical ML"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML;

The study investigates the feasibility of BP measurement using a chestworn patch sensor derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing measurements. Healthy volunteers (N=14, 38 \u00b1 13 years) carried out a protocol including deep breathing test, sustained hand grip test and modified Valsalva test with continuous physiological measurements from a patch sensor attached on left chest and intermittent BP measurements from an automated oscillometric monitor as a reference. The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values. The study demonstrated the feasibility of BP measurement using a wearable chest-worn patch sensor in healthy control subjects."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation

However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]}},"selected":{"id":"1126"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1127"}},"id":"1108","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["Deep Learning"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML+deep learning; classification to separate classes and then regression"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/S13534-019-00113-Z"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAAEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Omari et al."],"Authors raw":["T.

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg. This shows the feasibility of estimating of blood pressure using PCG."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation

abstract":["Blood pressure (BP) measurement data is an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","NaN","\u2026 , cuff-less and continuous blood pressure monitoring method to \u2026 blood pressure monitor should have continuous, portable, \u2026 to estimate both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic \u2026"],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[3]}},"selected":{"id":"1518"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1519"}},"id":"1486","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML; linear regression"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2018.8603612"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]},"Authors":["Rasool et al."],"Authors raw":["Anam Rasool, Muqudas Rafiq, Aisha Nasir, F.

Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP. RMS error, measured by leave-one-out method, reduced from 8.45 mm Hg to 5.77 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.67 mm Hg to 6.90 mm Hg for MAP."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[1]}},"selected":{"id":"1270"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1271"}},"id":"1246","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1591","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1302","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1300"},"glyph":{"id":"1302"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1303"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1305"}},"id":"1304","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAiQAAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAAqQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[14]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML","Classical ML","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Classical ML","Classical ML","proprietary","proprietary","Deep Learning","Classical ML","Deep Learning"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML; feature extraction; adaboost; Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest ","classical ML; MLR","deep learning; ANN","deep learning; fully connected","deep learning; Deep Belief Network","deep learning; transformer-based method with knowledge distillation; transfer learning","deep learning; transformer-based method with knowledge distillation; transfer learning","classical ML: Type-2 Fuzzy system and Multi-particle swarm optimization","classical ML; linear regression; gradient based","proprietary","proprietary","deep learning+classical ML; Spectograms-Resnet18; gradient boosting machines","classical ML; gaussian process regression+SVM","deep learning; LSTM"],"ArticleURL":["https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/8938751/","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/9616476/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2502315","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/8589796/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00134-013-2964-2","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/9795667","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/9795667","https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/30160/1/01Front.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3144730.3144737","https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/10/e14706/","https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/10/e14706/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.20107243","https://www.osapublishing.org/irrelevant; abstract.cfm?uri=boe-12-12-7732","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nikolas-Mastellos/publication/325333417_Wrist-worn_blood_pressure_tracking_in_healthy_free-living_individuals_using_neural_networks/links/5b3a0979a6fdcc8506e79a2b/Wrist-worn-blood-pressure-tracking-in-healthy-free-living-individuals-using-neural-networks.pdf"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAABhAAAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAmQAAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAACBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAACBAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAUQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[14]},"Authors":["Hasanzadeh et al.","Haddad et al.","Yang et al.","Priyanka et al.","Ruiz-Rodr\u00edguez et al.","Ma et al.","Ma et al.","Al-Jaafreh","Datta et al.","Islam et al.","Islam et al.","Sasso et al.","Dagamseh et al.","Radha et al."],"Authors raw":["N Hasanzadeh, MM Ahmadi, ...","S Haddad, A Boukhayma, ...","S.

However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient. With the ever increased urge for cuff-less continuous BP measurement, novel methods based on pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have gained its popularity. However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement. In contrast, the collection of PPG signals is comparatively simpler and easier, therefore, novel methods that extract features from PPG signal are receiving more attentions. However, previous studies only focus on the features extracted from the PPG signal and did not include the physiological characteristics, which can serve as important predictors for BP. To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","PurposeTo develop and validate a continuous non-invasive blood pressure (BP) monitoring system using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through pulse oximetry (PO).MethodsThis prospective study was conducted at a critical care department and post-anesthesia care unit of a university teaching hospital. Inclusion criteria were critically ill adult patients undergoing invasive BP measurement with an arterial catheter and PO monitoring. Exclusion criteria were arrhythmia, imminent death condition, and disturbances in the arterial or the PPG curve morphology. Arterial BP and finger PO waves were recorded simultaneously for 30\u00a0min. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were extracted from computer-assisted arterial pulse wave analysis. Inherent traits of both waves were used to construct a regression model with a Deep Belief Network-Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DBN-RBM) from a training cohort of patients and in order to infer BP values from the PO wave. Bland\u2013Altman analysis was performed.ResultsA total of 707 patients were enrolled, of whom 135 were excluded. Of the 572 studied, 525 were assigned to the training cohort (TC) and 47 to the validation cohort (VC). After data processing, 53,708 frames were obtained from the TC and 7,715 frames from the VC.

The results obtained with this technology are promising, but its intrinsic variability and its wide limits of agreement do not allow clinical application at this time.","NaN","NaN","In daily life every person needs continuous monitoring of temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure parameters and other parameters to have some idea about one's body systems performance and to assist doctors to diagnose one's health status. This information is more necessary for aged and unhealthy people, while it is also necessary for healthy person, who represents the undiagnosed subject. Usually, the healthy and unhealthy subjects are advised to measure their cardiovascular parameters at home at various times in a day to avoid any bad developments for their health status. Available self-measurement devices give only discrete readings and have not provided accurate information of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, and blood pressure parameters in many situations since most of them do not consider the body's movement or the uncertainty associated with the reading. Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 Box plot of ambulatory and wearable systolic and diastolic BP measurements.

Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 used to estimate the systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\u2026 system for BP estimation through developing wearable devices [\u2026 -based wearable cuffless noninvasive BP estimation system \u2026","\u2026 ) in BP of 5 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated \u2026 Cuff-less estimation of blood pressure using Pulse Transit \u2026 wearable device for overnight and cuff-less blood pressure \u2026"],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[14]}},"selected":{"id":"1170"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1171"}},"id":"1150","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1489","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1248","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1556"}},"id":"1561","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1556"},"glyph":{"id":"1558"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1559"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1561"}},"id":"1560","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1249","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1486"}},"id":"1491","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"biometrics+ECG+PPG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1200"},{"id":"1225"}]},"id":"1221","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAPA/AAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAAPA/AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAADwPwAAAAAAAPA/AAAAAAAACEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[16]},"Algorithm":["Physiological Model","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","proprietary","Classical ML","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Classical ML","Classical ML","Deep Learning","Deep Learning","Classical ML","Classical ML","proprietary"],"Algorithm raw":["physiological model","deep learning; CNN","deep learning; fully connected","proprietary","classical ML; log-linear model; regression; feature extraction","deep learning; CNN-LSTM","deep learning; auto-encoder; CNN","deep learning; CNN; VGG-16; 3D convolutions","deep learning; fully connected","classical ML; MLR; SVR","classical ML; RLR; decision trees; SVM; AdaBoost; random forests","deep learning; multi-filter to multi-channel; MLP-Mixer","deep learning; multi-filter to multi-channel; MLP-Mixer","classical ML; linear regression; poon model","classical ML; random forest+adaboost ","proprietary"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bsn.2009.23","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/8857373/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9207294","https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e16811","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JTEHM.2020.3000327","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92997-0","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/irrelevant; abstract/document/8857304/","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856588","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tim.2019.2947103","http://gtusitecirculars.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/PhDThesis_149997117002_TD_374601.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2016.2580904","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421010016","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421010016","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01358-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/abf889","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21548331.2019.1656991"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAGEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAAAhAAAAAAAAAEEAAAAAAAAAIQAAAAAAAAABAAAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAYQAAAAAAAAAhAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAQQAAAAAAAABRAAAAAAAAAFEAAAAAAAAAUQAAAAAAAABBAAAAAAAAAEEA=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[16]},"Authors":["Gu et al.","Li et al.","Chen et al.","Hahnen et al.","Singla et al.","Jeong et al.","Zhang et al.","Liu et al.","Song et al.","Arunbhai et al.","Kachuee et al.","Huang et al.","Huang et al.","Finnegan et al.","Zhang et al.","van et al."],"Authors raw":["W.B.

Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful. The advantages of the proposed filtering framework for both systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure estimation are demonstrated through the analysis and estimation of 12,000 clinical BP recordings, consisting of over 200,000 test samples.","\u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u2026 to conduct a study on cuff-less BP monitors using a mercury \u2026 cuffless device for ambulatory blood pressure measurement \u2026","Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) derived from Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) for cuff-less Blood Pressure (BP) measurement has been a contemporary and widely accepted technique. However, the features extracted for it are conventionally from an isolated pulse of ECG and PPG signals. As a result, the estimated BP is intermittent. Objective: This paper presents feature extraction from each beat of ECG and PPG signals to make BP measurements uninterrupted. These features are extracted by employing Haar transformation to adaptively attenuate measurement noise and improve the fiducial point detection precision. Method: the use of only PAT feature as an independent variable leads to an inaccurate estimation of either Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) or both. We propose the extraction of supplementary features that are highly correlated to physiological parameters. Concurrent data was collected as per the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) guidelines from 171 human subjects belonging to diverse age groups. An Adaptive Window Wavelet Transformation (AWWT) technique based on Haar wavelet transformation has been introduced to segregate pulses. Further, an algorithm based on log-linear regression analysis is developed to process extracted features from each beat to calculate BP. Results: The mean error of 0.43 and 0.20 mmHg, mean absolute error of 4.6 and 2.3 mmHg, and Standard deviation of 6.13 and 3.06 mmHg is achieved for SBP and DBP respectively. Conclusions: The features extracted are highly precise and evaluated BP values are as per the AAMI standards.

Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be \u2026 were estimated higher and higher SBPs were estimated lower (\u03c1 \u2026"],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[16]}},"selected":{"id":"1049"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1050"}},"id":"1035","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"fill_alpha":{"value":0.1},"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_alpha":{"value":0.1},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1153","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1360","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"ECG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1304"},{"id":"1333"}]},"id":"1329","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"biometrics+PPG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1490"},{"id":"1525"}]},"id":"1521","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1049","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1223","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1246"}},"id":"1251","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"pressure+PPG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1560"},{"id":"1597"}]},"id":"1593","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1218","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"1150"}},"id":"1155","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"piezo+PPG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1250"},{"id":"1277"}]},"id":"1273","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1632","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"label":{"value":"PPG"},"renderers":[{"id":"1154"},{"id":"1177"}]},"id":"1173","type":"LegendItem"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1558","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1326","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"fill_color":{"field":"fill_color"},"line_color":{"value":"#1f77b4"},"size":{"field":"Marker Size","units":"screen"},"x":{"field":"Explained Deviation DBP"},"y":{"field":"Explained Deviation SBP"}},"id":"1198","type":"Circle"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"1196"},"glyph":{"id":"1198"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"nonselection_glyph":{"id":"1199"},"selection_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"1201"}},"id":"1200","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1327","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{},"id":"1590","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA8D8AAAAAAADwPw==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML","Deep Learning"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML;

A cuffless device that can measure BP without calibration would be precious for portability, continuous measurement, and comfortability, but unfortunately, it does not currently exist. Conventional BP measurement with a cuff is standard, but this method has various problems like inaccurate BP measurement, poor portability, and painful cuff pressure. To overcome these disadvantages, many researchers have developed cuffless BP estimation devices. However, these devices are not clinically applicable because they require advanced preparation before use, such as calibration, do not follow international standards (81060-1:2007), or have been designed using insufficient data sets. The present study was conducted to combat these issues. We recruited 127 participants and obtained 878 raw datasets. According to international standards, our diverse data set included participants from different age groups with a wide variety of blood pressures. We utilized ML to formulate a BP estimation method that did not require calibration. The present study also conformed to the method required by international standards while calculating the level of error in BP estimation. Two essential methods were applied in this study: (a) grouping the participants into five subsets based on the relationship between the pulse transit time and systolic BP by a support vector machine ensemble with bagging (b) applying the information from the wavelet transformation of the pulse wave and the electrocardiogram to the linear regression BP estimation model for each group. For systolic BP, the standard deviation of error for the proposed BP estimation results with cross-validation was 7.74 mmHg, which was an improvement from 17.05 mmHg, as estimated by the conventional pulse-transit-time-based methods. For diastolic BP, the standard deviation of error was 6.42 mmHg for the proposed BP estimation, which was an improvement from 14.05mmHg.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation."],"wearablebp.github.io Implementation Result":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAA+H8AAAAAAAD4fwAAAAAAAPh/AAAAAAAA+H8=","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[4]}},"selected":{"id":"1326"},"selection_policy":{"id":"1327"}},"id":"1300","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"data":{"Age":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAACEAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Algorithm":["Classical ML","Physiological Model"],"Algorithm raw":["classical ML; adaptive estimation of systole ratio","model; parametric model; branchial BP equations"],"ArticleURL":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3300061.3345454","https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/scitranslmed.aap8674"],"AuthorCount":{"__ndarray__":"AAAAAAAAKkAAAAAAAAAQQA==","dtype":"float64","order":"little","shape":[2]},"Authors":["Bui et al.","Chandrasekhar et al."],"Authors raw":["Nam Bui, Nhat Pham, Jessica Jacqueline Barnitz, Zhanan Zou, Phuc Nguyen, Anh-Hoang Truong, Taeho Kim, N.

abstract":["Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

Consequently, even a small portion of abnormal data samples can severely impact the overall signal quality and therefore lead to significantly distorted BP value estimates. To this end, a data-driven model is proposed to infer the beat-to-beat signal quality for the ECG, PPG and BP signal recordings, whereby high-quality and low-quality (outlier) beats are detected using a probabilistic model chosen according to the maximum entropy principle. Physiological rules are also imposed to guarantee that each filtered sample is physiologically meaningful.

However, the features extracted for it are conventionally from an isolated pulse of ECG and PPG signals. As a result, the estimated BP is intermittent. Objective: This paper presents feature extraction from each beat of ECG and PPG signals to make BP measurements uninterrupted. These features are extracted by employing Haar transformation to adaptively attenuate measurement noise and improve the fiducial point detection precision. Method: the use of only PAT feature as an independent variable leads to an inaccurate estimation of either Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) or Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) or both. We propose the extraction of supplementary features that are highly correlated to physiological parameters. Concurrent data was collected as per the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) guidelines from 171 human subjects belonging to diverse age groups. An Adaptive Window Wavelet Transformation (AWWT) technique based on Haar wavelet transformation has been introduced to segregate pulses. Further, an algorithm based on log-linear regression analysis is developed to process extracted features from each beat to calculate BP. Results: The mean error of 0.43 and 0.20 mmHg, mean absolute error of 4.6 and 2.3 mmHg, and Standard deviation of 6.13 and 3.06 mmHg is achieved for SBP and DBP respectively. Conclusions: The features extracted are highly precise and evaluated BP values are as per the AAMI standards. Clinical Impact: This continuous real-time BP monitoring technique can be useful in the treatment of hypertensive and potential-hypertensive subjects.","Hypertension has become the most common chronic disease which brings a heavy medical burden to society. However, current intermittent measuring instruments, such as electronic sphygmomanometer, cannot monitor blood pressure (BP) in real time. At the same time, there are calibration steps in ambulatory measuring instruments represented by pulse arrival time (PAT)-based measuring instruments, which are inconvenient for patients. In order to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings, this study developed a wrist-based wearable real-time measurement system without calibration steps. Based on the hemodynamic principle of the linear relationship between the waveform parameters of Photoplethysmography (PPG)-Ballistocardiography (BCG) and BP, the systolic and diastolic blood pressure prediction results of this device had a correlation coefficient of 0.9 and 0.92, respectively, compared with the actual values. The MAD and RMSE were 3.08 \u00b1 4.29 mmHg and 1.52 \u00b1 2.20 mmHg correspondingly, which was superior to traditional PAT-based BP prediction devices. The results showed that the device has the advantages of simplicity and accuracy, which helps to improve the quality of life for patients and reduce the medical burden caused by hypertension.","\u2026 in smaller estimation errors for systolic and diastolic BPs compared to the \u2026 Fu, \u201cCuffless blood pressure estimation based on \u2026 Ryu, \u201cPPG-based systolic blood pressure estimation method \u2026","This study presents a new blood pressure (BP) estimation algorithm utilizing machine learning (ML). A cuffless device that can measure BP without calibration would be precious for portability, continuous measurement, and comfortability, but unfortunately, it does not currently exist. Conventional BP measurement with a cuff is standard, but this method has various problems like inaccurate BP measurement, poor portability, and painful cuff pressure. To overcome these disadvantages, many researchers have developed cuffless BP estimation devices. However, these devices are not clinically applicable because they require advanced preparation before use, such as calibration, do not follow international standards (81060-1:2007), or have been designed using insufficient data sets. The present study was conducted to combat these issues. We recruited 127 participants and obtained 878 raw datasets. According to international standards, our diverse data set included participants from different age groups with a wide variety of blood pressures. We utilized ML to formulate a BP estimation method that did not require calibration. The present study also conformed to the method required by international standards while calculating the level of error in BP estimation. Two essential methods were applied in this study: (a) grouping the participants into five subsets based on the relationship between the pulse transit time and systolic BP by a support vector machine ensemble with bagging (b) applying the information from the wavelet transformation of the pulse wave and the electrocardiogram to the linear regression BP estimation model for each group. For systolic BP, the standard deviation of error for the proposed BP estimation results with cross-validation was 7.74 mmHg, which was an improvement from 17.05 mmHg, as estimated by the conventional pulse-transit-time-based methods. For diastolic BP, the standard deviation of error was 6.42 mmHg for the proposed BP estimation, which was an improvement from 14.05mmHg. The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the newly developed BP estimation ML method that meets the international standard for non-invasive sphygmomanometers in a population with a diverse range of age and BP.","\u2026 During the study, carotid local PWV and brachial blood pressure (\u2026 in the estimated systolic and diastolic pressure was 7.53 \u2026 and wearable devices for cuffless evaluation of arterial blood \u2026","\u2026 features to predict systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) using \u2026 is the guideline for evaluation of the wearable, cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices 14 . \u2026","Continuous and noninvasive monitoring of blood pressure is of vital importance in critical care. Its role in management of patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease is ever increasing. Pulse-transit-time based approaches for estimation of blood pressure hold potential to provide a convenient solution, however there is a need to improve their accuracy. We employ a novel two-sensor technique using photoplethysmogram and piezo sensors for a more accurate measurement of pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is then mapped to arterial blood pressure via calibration process. We implement two different techniques for the PTT measurement. The first technique uses two pulse sensors, while the second technique makes use of one pulse sensor and one piezo element. Clinical data is collected from 46 subjects in the form of systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure to provide a reference for the calibration step in two techniques. The results show decrease in error of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the second technique. The root mean square (RMS) error, measured for the calibration equations, reduced from 7.72 mm Hg to 5.26 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.07 mm Hg to 6.30 mm Hg for MAP. RMS error, measured by leave-one-out method, reduced from 8.45 mm Hg to 5.77 mm Hg for SAP and from 7.67 mm Hg to 6.90 mm Hg for MAP.","\u2026 are easy to collect using wearable devices.

An accurate noninvasive device that measures BP continuously could provide a more comprehensive assessment of BP. The aim of this study was to determine whether the LiveOne device, a cuffless wristband that provides continuous BP measurements, is accurate in comparison to an invasive arterial line (A-line). METHODS: We enrolled hospitalized patients and healthy volunteers in this multicenter study. All patients had an invasive A-line. Waveforms were simultaneously downloaded from the A-line and LiveOne device. The primary outcome was the correlation between the LiveOne device and the A-line for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with 233 measurement periods were included. Mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 15.2 years, and 15 (44%) were female. The correlation for SBP was 0.91 and for DBP was 0.85. The mean band error was 0.0 \u00b1 6.9 mm Hg for SBP and 1.2 \u00b1 5.7 mm Hg for DBP. The mean absolute error was 8.2 \u00b1 5.8 mm Hg for SBP and 6.4 \u00b1 3.9 mm Hg for DBP. For SBP, 98% of LiveOne measurements were within 15 mm Hg and for DBP, 92% of LiveOne measurements were within 10 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: The LiveOne device provides continuous, noninvasive BP measurements that are accurate in comparison to A-line measurements. The portability and unobtrusive nature of this device and the ability to provide continuous BP measurements may offer advantages over currently available BP monitors.

However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy.","\u2026 , with corresponding systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) \u2026 monitoring, which would make this work more potential for application in the wearable monitoring \u2026","Cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring is increasingly being needed for cardiovascular events management in clinical.

The deep network architecture has the ability of automatic feature learning, and the learned features are the higher-level irrelevant; abstract description of low-level raw physiological signals. Eight-nine middle-aged and elderly subjects were enrolled to evaluate the performance of the proposed BP estimation method, with oscillometric technique-based BP as a reference. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method had a commendable accuracy in BP estimation, with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and an estimation error of -2.06 \u00b1 6.89 mmHg for systolic BP, and 0.89 and -4.66 \u00b1 4.91 mmHg for diastolic BP. This study shows that the proposed method provided a potential novel insight for the cuff-less BP estimation.","Blood pressure (BP) measurement data is an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life. However, conventional measurement does not provide continuous monitoring data and sometimes is considered as inconvenient.

However, the collection of ECG signals involves the application of electrodes and inconvenience due to lengthy continuous measurement.

To improve the accuracy in the estimation of BP based on the PPG signal, this study not only extracts features from the PPG signal, but also includes the physiological characteristics of total 191 sets of subjects, such as height, weight, and age. After pre-processing the raw PPG signal, different machine learning methods are used to estimate the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the systolic blood pressure (SBP). The mean absolute error of DBP and SBP are 4.13 mmHg and 9.18 mmHg respectively. The results complied with the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standards and the implementation of physiological characteristics improved the accuracy of BP estimation.","Blood pressure (BP) measurement data is an important indication of health and quality of life in clinical medicine and daily life.

Current \"gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.","\u2026 -invasive cuff-less blood pressure measurement techniques \u2026 the estimated outputs are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and \u2026 , \"Adaptive blood pressure estimation from wearable PPG \u2026","Pulse arrival time (PAT) and pulse transit time (PTT) derived from the finger have been widely investigated for noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement.

The efficacy of chest derived PAT and PTT for univariate BP prediction is assessed using correlation and regression slope. The cross validation performance of predicting BP using multivariate regression model with chest derived systolic timing intervals and pulse timing features were also evaluated. The results suggest that the chest derived PAT and PTT had modest correlations (-0.52 and -0.31) and regression slopes (-0.21 and -0.14) with automated oscillometric systolic and diastolic BP references, respectively. On the other hand, a multivariate regression approach for prediction of mean blood pressure (MBP) using patch sensor measurements showed a correlation of 0.72, mean error of 0.1 mmHg and RMSE error of 5.1 mmHg compared to the oscillometric MBP values.

A pumpdriven pneumatic bladder presses the tactile array and the finger towards each other to obtain a pressure sweep versus time. The digital artery pressure waveform data collected during this sweep are used to estimate arterial blood pressure.

Moreover, Blood pressure parameters (BPP): Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Blood Pressures, have some types of correlation with the heart rate. This relationship is nonlinear and has Inany levels of uncertainty. The Type-2 Fuzzy system has a capacity to deal with nonlinear and uncertainty systems. The estimate of Blood pressure parameters based on heart rate can be categorized under such systems that fuzzy system can deal with. This thesis presents a novel algorithm to measure photo-plethysmography signal, heart rate and the oxygen saturation level and also to estimate BPPs for healthy and unhealthy subjects based on a prototype transducer, particle swarm optimization and type-2 Fuzzy System. The measured values of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures by utilizing the novel algorithn1 are compared with the clinical readings of heart rate, oxygen saturation level, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure.","Blood pressure (BP) is considered to be an important biomarker for cardiac risk estimation. This paper deals with a non-conventional way of estimating BP using smartphone captured Photoplethysmogram (PPG) that enables unobtrusive health monitoring at home for possible alert generation. We have proposed a set of features that are independent to the inbuilt sensor of the capturing device. It is also observed that, BP estimated from a typical smartphone PPG signal fluctuates in successive cardiac cycles due to poor signal quality compared to a medical grade device. Hence, a novel post processing block is introduced, that rejects data depending on the BP distribution over all cardiac cycles in a session. Finally, Half Range Mode is used as a statistical average for the accepted sessions. This post processing methodology outperforms standard statistical averages in providing a better representative BP per session. The methodology yields mean absolute errors of 7.4% and 9.1% for predicting systolic and diastolic pressure respectively when validated over a dataset with a wide variation of BP.","\u2026 to predict systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 SeismoWatch: wearable cuffless blood pressure monitoring \u2026 Cuffless and non-invasive systolic blood pressure estimation \u2026","\u2026 to predict systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure \u2026 SeismoWatch: wearable cuffless blood pressure monitoring \u2026 Cuffless and non-invasive systolic blood pressure estimation \u2026","\u2026 of this method were promising for estimating systolic BP, but in the estimation of diastolic \u2026 cuff-less and24-H wearable blood pressure monitoring and its diagnostic value inhypertension, \u2026","\u2026 -pressing method for cuff-less BP monitoring using a smartphone. \u2026 within a single, portable device.

To achieve continuous and cuffless BP monitoring, pulse transit time (PTT) has been reported as a potential parameter. Nevertheless, this approach remains very sensitive, cumbersome and disagreeable in ambulatory measurement. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate blood pressure through PCG signal by exploring the correlation between PTT and diastolic duration (S21). In this purpose, an artificial neural network was developed using as input data: (systolic duration, diastolic duration, heart rate, sex, height and weight). According to the NN decision, the mean blood pressure was measured and consequently the systolic and the diastolic pressures were estimated. The proposed method is evaluated on 37 subjects. The obtained results are satisfactory, where, the error in the estimation of the systolic and the diastolic pressures compared to the commercial blood pressure device was in the order of $$6.48 \\pm 4.48$$6.48\u00b14.48\u00a0mmHg and $$3.91 \\pm 2.58$$3.91\u00b12.58\u00a0mmHg, respectively, which are very close to the AAMI standard, $$5 \\pm 8$$5\u00b18\u00a0mmHg. This shows the feasibility of estimating of blood pressure using PCG.","NaN","NaN","NaN","The state of the art for monitoring hypertension relies on measuring blood pressure (BP) using uncomfortable cuff-based devices. Hence, for increased adherence in monitoring, a better way of measuring BP is needed. That could be achieved through comfortable wearables that contain photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. There have been several studies showing the possibility of statistically estimating systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) from PPG signals. However, they are either based on measurements of healthy subjects or on patients on intensive care units (ICUs). Thus, there is a lack of studies with patients out of the normal range of BP and with daily life monitoring out of the ICUs. To address this, we created a dataset (HYPE) composed of data from hypertensive subjects that executed a stress test and had 24-hours monitoring. We then trained and compared machine learning (ML) models to predict BP. We evaluated handcrafted feature extraction approaches vs image representation ones and compared different ML algorithms for both. Moreover, in order to evaluate the models in a different scenario, we used an openly available set from a stress test with healthy subjects (EVAL). The best results for our HYPE dataset were in the stress test and had a mean absolute error (MAE) in mmHg of 8.79 (SD 3.17) for SBP and 6.37 (SD 2.62) for DBP; for our EVAL dataset it was 14.74 (SD 4.06) and 7.12 (SD 2.32) respectively. Although having tested a range of signal processing and ML techniques, we were not able to reproduce the small error ranges claimed in the literature. The mixed results suggest a need for more comparative studies with subjects out of the intensive care and across all ranges of blood pressure. Until then, the clinical relevance of PPG-based predictions in daily life should remain an open question.","\u2026 wearable product.

Recently, the use of ECG monitors has proliferated; however, they are not enabled with BP estimation. We have developed a method for BP estimation using only electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Methods: Raw ECG data are filtered and segmented, and, following this, a complexity analysis is performed for feature extraction. Then, a machine-learning method is applied, combining a stacking-based classification module and a regression module for building systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) predictive models. In addition, the method allows a probability distribution-based calibration to adapt the models to a particular user. Results: Using ECG recordings from 51 different subjects, 3129 30-s ECG segments are constructed, and seven features are extracted. Using a train-validation-test evaluation, the method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.64 mmHg for SBP, 18.20 mmHg for DBP, and 13.52 mmHg for the MAP prediction. When models are calibrated, the MAE decreases to 7.72 mmHg for SBP, 9.45 mmHg for DBP and 8.13 mmHg for MAP. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that, when a probability distribution-based calibration is used, the proposed method can achieve results close to those of a certified medical device for BP estimation.","\u2026 developed a wearable armband, capable of recording \u2026 In this study, estimation of the calibration curve required monitoring \u2026 Cuff-less and noninvasive measurements of arterial blood \u2026","\u2026 developed a wearable armband, capable of recording \u2026 In this study, estimation of the calibration curve required monitoring \u2026 Cuff-less and noninvasive measurements of arterial blood \u2026","Objective. Noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measurement technologies have been widely studied, but they still have the disadvantages of low accuracy, the requirement for frequent calibration and limited subjects. This work considers the regulation of vascular activity by the sympathetic nervous system and proposes a method for estimating BP using multiple physiological parameters. Approach. The parameters used in the model consist of heart rate variability (HRV), pulse transit time (PTT) and pulse wave morphology features extracted from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals. Through four classic machine learning algorithms, a hybrid data set of 3337 subjects from two databases is evaluated to verify the ability of cross-database migration. We also recommend an individual calibration procedure to further improve the accuracy of the method. Main results. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm is 10.03 and 14.55 mmHg for systolic BP (SBP), and 5.42 and 8.19 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). With individual calibration, the MAE and standard deviation (SD) is \u22120.16 \u00b1 7.96 (SBP) and \u22120.13 \u00b1 4.50 (DBP) mmHg, which satisfied the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standard. In addition, the models are used to test single databases to evaluate their performance on different data sources. The overall performance of the Adaboost algorithm is better on the Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care Unit (MIMIC) database; the MAE between its predicted value and true value reaches 6.6mmHg (SBP) and 3.12mmHg (DBP), respectively. Significance. The proposed method considers the regulation of blood vessels and the heart by the autonomic nervous system, and verifies its effectiveness and robustness across data sources, which is promising for improving the accuracy of continuous and cuffless BP estimation.","\u2026 and precision of two popular cuff-less devices: the Everlast \u2026 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements can be

<h4> Personalization </h4>

It is notbale that less than 10% of the personalization studies include information about the change in BP distribution. Even though there are studies that report the initial BP distribution of subjects, this is not sufficient, as some experiments do not allow sufficient variation in BP. As a consequence, allowing the intial calibrated BP values to be the estimator can lead to small errors. A scatter plot of ED for SBP/DBP is shown below.

Predictive models to estimate BP using a variety of sensor-\u2026 Although this study demonstrates an evaluation of cuffless BP in the setting \u2026","Although various predictors and methods for BP estimation have been proposed, differences in study designs have led to difficulties in determining the optimal method. This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg. For the DBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20131.30 \u00b1 7.18 mmHg. The results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is within the 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg ISO/ANSI/AAMI protocol requirement.","\u2026 In this study, we aimed to estimate blood pressure (BP) from in-\u2026 Calibrated systolic BP estimation accuracy was significantly \u2026 for wearable cuff-less blood pressure monitoring system Sci. \u2026","\u2026 was 6.70 mmHg for systolic and 4.42 for diastolic BP.

This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg. For the DBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20131.30 \u00b1 7.18 mmHg. The results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is within the 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg ISO/ANSI/AAMI protocol requirement.","\u2026 increased or decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SP and DP) \u2026 below) were available to estimate the BP change prediction model\u2026 We specifically estimated 32 models using data from all \u2026","NaN","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

Predictive models to estimate BP using a variety of sensor-\u2026 Although this study demonstrates an evaluation of cuffless BP in the setting \u2026","Although various predictors and methods for BP estimation have been proposed, differences in study designs have led to difficulties in determining the optimal method. This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg.

This study presents analyses of BP estimation methods using 2.4 million cardiac cycles of two commonly used non-invasive biosignals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG), from 1376 surgical patients. Feature selection methods were used to determine the best subset of predictors from a total of 42 including PAT, heart rate (HR), and various PPG morphology features, and BP estimation models constructed using linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) were evaluated. 28 features out of 42 were determined as suitable for BP estimation, in particular two PPG morphology features outperformed PAT, which has been conventionally seen as the best non-invasive indicator of BP. By modelling the low frequency component of BP using ANN and the high frequency component using RNN with the selected predictors, mean errors of 0.05 \u00b1 6.92 mmHg for systolic BP, and -0.05 \u00b1 3.99 mmHg for diastolic BP were achieved. External validation of the model using another biosignal database consisting of 334 intensive care unit patients led to similar results, satisfying three standards for accuracy of BP monitors. The results indicate that the proposed method can contribute to the realization of ubiquitous non-invasive continuous BP monitoring.","In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of our cuffless photoplethysmography based blood pressure monitoring (PPG-BPM) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated on an ultra low power photoplethysmography (PPG) signal acquired from the Senbiosys Ring. The study involves six male subjects wearing the ring for continuous finger PPG recordings and non-invasive brachial cuff inflated every two to ten minutes for intermittent blood pressure (BP) measurements. Each subject performs the required recordings two to three times with at least two weeks difference between any two recordings. In total, the study includes 17 recordings 2.21 \u00b1 0.89 hours each. The PPG recordings are processed by the PPG-BPM algorithm to generate systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimates. For the SBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20130.28 \u00b1 7.54 mmHg. For the DBP, the mean difference between the cuff-based and the PPG-BPM values is \u20131.30 \u00b1 7.18 mmHg. The results show that the accuracy of our algorithm is within the 5 \u00b1 8 mmHg ISO/ANSI/AAMI protocol requirement.","\u2026 increased or decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SP and DP) \u2026 below) were available to estimate the BP change prediction model\u2026 We specifically estimated 32 models using data from all \u2026","NaN","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Current standard ABPM devices use an oscillometric cuff-based method which can cause physical discomfort to the patients with repeated inflations and deflations, especially during nighttime leading to sleep disturbance. The ability to measure ambulatory BP accurately and comfortably without a cuff would be attractive. This study validated the accuracy of a cuff-less approach for ABPM using pulse arrival time (PAT) measurements on both healthy and hypertensive subjects for potential use in hypertensive management, which is the first of its kind. The wearable cuff-less device was evaluated against a standard cuff-based device on 24 subjects of which 15 have known hypertension. BP measurements were taken from each subject over a 24-h period by the cuff-less and cuff-based devices every 15 to 30\u00a0minutes during daily activities. Mean BP of each subject during daytime, nighttime and over 24-h were calculated. Agreement between mean nighttime systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) measured by the two devices evaluated using Bland-Altman plot were \u22121.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 and 0.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) statistics was used to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the cuff-less approach in the detection of BP above the hypertension threshold during nighttime (&gt;120/70\u00a0mmHg). The area under ROC curves were 0.975/0.79 for nighttime. The results suggest that PAT-based approach is accurate and promising for ABPM without the issue of sleep disturbances associated with cuff-based devices.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of hypertension.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

Pulse arrival time (PAT) based technique was considered as one of the most promising methods for this purpose. Considering the dynamic and nonlinear relationship between BP, PAT and other cardiovascular variables, this paper proposes for the first time to use nonlinear autoregressive models with extra inputs (ARX) for BP estimation. The models were first trained by the baseline data of all 25 subjects to determine the model structure and then trained by individual data to obtain the personalized model parameters. To assess the effects of the dynamic and nonlinear factors, the data during water drinking and the first 5 minutes of recovery after drinking were used to validate the four models: linear regression, linear ARX, nonlinear regression and nonlinear ARX. The reference BP, which were measured by Finometer, were increased by 36.7\u00b110.5 mmHg for SBP and 28.4 \u00b17.7 mmHg for DBP. This BP changes were best modelled by the nonlinear ARX, with Mean \u00b1 SD differences of 5.6 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg for SBP and 3.8 \u00b15.8 mmHg for DBP. The study also showed that nonlinear factor significantly reduced the root mean square error (RSME) by about 50%, i.e., from 20.4 to 10.7 mmHg for SBP and 13.3 to 7.3 mmHg for DBP during drinking. While the effects of dynamic factors were not as significant as nonlinear factors, especially after introducing nonlinear factors.","\u2026 by an eyeglasses-based wearable device.

Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) and Pulse Transit Time (PTT) are considered considered as a well-established feature, yet there are no studies that demonstrate an ED that are greater or equal to the computed ED of the requirements. All of the PAT/PTT studies cluster around the 1, with some that are below the error boundaries established by the standards.

<p>This website accompanies our review “Wearable Blood Pressure Monitoring Devices: Understanding Heterogeneity in Design and Evaluation” (under review). The goal of this website is to allow researchers to understand the state of Wearable BP and to better identify promising research directions. Here, you can find:</p>

<h2> Collaboration </h2>

<p>There’s much more work to be done in this space. The future for cuffless BP looks bright, and there’s a lot of momentum. We want to be sure that we can better identify promising research directions and ensure our time and efforts are fruitful. If you’re interested in collaborating, please connect with me on X (matte_ce) or email (mattyc at rice dot edu)</p>

    "content": "It is important for a study to have reproducible results so the algorithms can be tested on other datasets for validity. Not only do these algorithms include estimation models, but they also include the data filtering algorithms that may shift the training and testing set distributions. We benchmark the data filtering algorithms and model combinations on publically available datasets. The implementation was done based on the code provided (on GitHub) and/or the details of the algorithms presented in the paper. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; . Bokeh Plot . To tackle this, we referee a table of benchmarks for wearable BP montoring and provide a machine learning pipeline for BP estimation. A diagram of the pipline is shown below in Fig. Every benchmark that will be reported here will follow strict guidelines on sharing code and reporting results. We provide an update form for researchers to improve upon existing benchmarks and add new benchmarks. Finally, the benchmarks currently only cover ECG and PPG. However, as wearable sensors become cheaper and more ubiquitous, the benchmarks will be expanded to include them. ",

    "content": "In addition to the performance criteria stated in the standards, we condition our performance metric based on the BP distribution, which is a significant source of heterogeneity between studies. To accomplish this, we adopt an interpretable statistic coined Explained Deviation (ED). For subject level split, ED is used to compute the effectiveness of a device with estimation error parameterized by ($\\mu_\\epsilon, \\sigma_\\epsilon$) on a population parameterized by (\\(\\mu_{pop}\\), \\(\\sigma_{pop}\\)), where $\\mu$ represents the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) represents the standard deviation. The ED can be computed as \\(ED = \\frac{\\sigma_{pop}}{\\sigma_\\epsilon}\\). The higher the ED, the better the system performs. On the other hand, an ED of 1 indicates that the estimator performs no better than an estimator that predicts a constant value. Intuitively, this statistic determines how much the model “explains” the BP distribution. Statistically, ED is similar to an F-test for the ratio of two variances with equal sample size, the null hypothesis \\(H_0: ED \\leq ED_{min}\\), and the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1: ED &gt; ED_{min}\\) where \\(ED_{min}\\) is the computed minimum Explained Deviation that meets the standards (See Supplementary 1). One limitation of using ED is the assumptions of zero bias and normality, which are not always the case. However, this gives a good ballpark estimate in practice. Furthermore, we can compute confidence intervals using the F-distribution by determining the bounds \\(P(\\sqrt{F_{\\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est} \\leq ED_{true} \\leq \\sqrt{F_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1, n-1)} ED_{est}) = 1-\\alpha\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) is the level of significance, \\(P\\) are the probability, \\(F\\) is the F-distribution and \\(n\\) in the sample size (Supplementary 1). The Margin of Error is half the Confidence Interval. Using the same formulation, we compute ED for personalization. However, in this case, we must take the change in BP of each subject into account: \\(ED = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta BP, err}}{\\sigma_{\\Delta BP}}\\), where \\(\\sigma_{\\Delta BP, err}\\) is the BP change error of the study cohort and \\(\\sigma_{\\Delta BP}\\) is the standard deviation of the BP changes of the study cohort. Finally, to determine whether the sample size is sufficient to detect the reported result, we compute power (\\(p\\)). To do this we define \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), \\(\\beta=0.02\\), and effect size \\(ES=\\frac{5}{8}\\), based on ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2019. This corresponds to \\(p=0.98\\) and a sample size of approximately 85 (Supplementary 2). ",

Currently, there are no publicly available datasets that satisfy these demographics. However, the PPG-BP can meet these requirements if it is subsampled. To determine a subsample that satisfied the AAMI/ANSI/ISO Standards, we performed weighted sampling of subjects, where the weights were determined using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) marginalized on the requirements. We repeat this process 10000 times and determine the minimum variance of the subsampled datasets. Then, we took the maximum error standard deviation allowed by AAMI/ANSI/ISO (±8mmHg). The minimum ED for SBP and DBP was computed to be 2.17 and 1.39. The implementation can be found on Github. ",
